{"id":"KILT_3995","text":" Contract bridge  Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck.  In its basic format, it is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table.  Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world's most popular card games, particularly among seniors.  The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level.   The game consists of several , each progressing through four phases.  The cards are dealt to the players, and then the players ‘’call’’ (or ‘’bid’’) in an auction to take the , specifying how many tricks the partnership receiving the contract (the declaring side) needs to take to receive points for the deal.  During the auction, partners communicate information about their hand, including its overall strength and the length of its suits, although conventions for use during play also exist.  The cards are then played, the trying to fulfill the contract, and the trying to stop the declaring side from achieving its goal. \nThe deal is scored based on the number of tricks taken, the contract, and various other factors which depend to some extent on the variation of the game being played.  Rubber bridge is the most popular variation for casual play, but most club and tournament play involves some variant of duplicate bridge, in which the cards are not re-dealt on each occasion, but the same deal is played by two or more sets of players (or \"tables\") to enable comparative scoring.  For competition level, so called IMP score is of high significance.   Section::::Etymology.   One theory is that the name \"bridge\" has its origins in the name of an earlier game.  Bridge departed from whist with the creation of in the 19th century, and evolved through the late 19th and early 20th centuries to form the present game.  The word \"biritch\" itself is a spelling of the Russian word (бирчий, бирич), an occupation of a diplomatic clerk or an announcer.  However some experts think that the Russian origin of the game is a fallacy.   Another theory is that British soldiers invented the game bridge while serving in the Crimean War. \nThe game \"got its name from the Galata Bridge, a bridge spanning the Golden Horn and linking the old and new parts of European Istanbul, where they apparently crossed every day to go to a coffeehouse to play cards.\"  Section::::Gameplay.   Section::::Gameplay.:Overview.   Bridge is a four-player partnership trick-taking game with thirteen tricks per deal.  The dominant variations of the game are rubber bridge, more common in social play; and duplicate bridge, which enables comparative scoring in tournament play.  Each player is dealt thirteen cards from a standard 52-card deck.  A starts when a player leads, i.e. plays the first card.  The leader to the first trick is determined by the auction; the leader to each subsequent trick is the player who won the preceding trick.  Each player, in a clockwise order, plays one card on the trick.  Players must play a card of the same suit as the original card led, unless they have none (said to be \"void\"), in which case they may play any card.   The player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick.  Within a suit, the ace is ranked highest followed by the king, queen and jack and then the ten through to the two. \nIn a deal where the auction has determined that there is no trump suit, the trick must be won by a card of the suit led. However, in a deal where there is a trump suit, cards of that suit are superior in rank to any of the cards of any other suit.  If one or more players plays a trump to a trick when void in the suit led, the highest trump wins.  For example, if the trump suit is spades and a player is void in the suit led and plays a spade card, he wins the trick if no other player plays a higher spade.  If a trump suit is led, the usual rule for trick-taking applies.   Unlike its predecessor Whist, the goal of bridge is not simply to take the most tricks in a deal.  Instead, the goal is to successfully estimate how many tricks one's partnership can take.  To illustrate this, the simpler partnership trick-taking game of Spades has a similar mechanism: the usual trick-taking rules apply with the trump suit being spades, but in the beginning of the game, players \"bid\" or estimate how many tricks they can win, and the number of tricks bid by both players in a partnership are added. \nIf a partnership takes at least that many number of tricks, they receive points for the round; otherwise, they receive penalty points.  Bridge extends the concept of bidding into an , where partnerships compete to take a , specifying how many tricks they will need to take in order to receive points, and also specifying the trump suit (or no trump, meaning that there will be no trump suit).  Players take turns to call in a clockwise order: each player in turn either passes, doubleswhich increases the penalties for not making the contract specified by the opposing partnership's last bid, but also increases the reward for making itor redoubles, or states a contract that their partnership will adopt, which must be higher than the previous highest bid (if any).  Eventually, the player who bid the highest contractwhich is determined by the contract's level as well as the trump suit or no trumpwins the contract for their partnership.   In the example auction on the right, the East-West pair secures the contract of 6; the auction concludes when there have been three successive passes.  Note that six tricks are added to contract values, so the six-level contract would actually be a contract of twelve tricks. \nIn practice, establishing a contract without enough information on the other partner's hand is difficult, so there exist many bidding systems assigning meanings to bids, with common ones including Standard American, Acol, and 2/1 game forcing. Contrast with Spades, where players only have to bid their own hand.   After the contract is decided, and the first lead is made, the declarer's partner (dummy) lays his cards face up on the table, and the declarer plays the dummy's cards as well as their own.  The opposing partnership is called the , and their goal is to stop the declarer from fulfilling his contract.  Once all the cards have been played, the hand is scored: if the declaring side make their contract, they receive points based on the level of the contract, with some trump suits being worth more points than others and no trump being the highest, as well as bonus points for .  But if the declarer fails to fulfil the contract, the defenders receive points depending on the declaring side's undertricks (the number of tricks short of the contract) and whether the contract was doubled by the defenders.   Section::::Gameplay.:Setup and dealing.   The four players sit in two partnerships, with each player sitting opposite his partner. \nA cardinal direction is assigned to each seat, so that one partnership sits in North and South, while the other sits in West and East. The cards may be freshly dealt or, in duplicate bridge games, pre-dealt.  All that is needed in basic games are the cards and a method of keeping score, but there is often other equipment on the table, such as a board containing the cards to be played (in duplicate bridge), bidding boxes, or screens.   In rubber bridge, each player draws a card at the start of the game: the two players who drew the highest cards are partners, and play against the other two.  The deck is shuffled and cut, usually by the player to the left of the dealer, before dealing.  Players take turns to deal, in a clockwise order.  The dealer deals the cards clockwise, one card at a time.   In duplicate bridge, the cards are pre-dealt, either by hand or by a computerized dealing machine, in order to allow for competitive scoring.  Once dealt, the cards are placed in a device called a \"board\", having slots designated for each player's cardinal direction seating position. \nAfter a deal has been played, players return their cards to the appropriate slot in the board, ready to be played by the next table.  Section::::Gameplay.:Auction.  The dealer opens the auction and can make the first call, and the auction proceeds clockwise.  When it is their turn to call, a player may passbut can enter into the bidding lateror bid a contract, specifying the level of their contract and either the trump suit or no trump (the denomination), provided that it is higher than the last bid by any player, including their partner.  All bids promise to take a number of tricks in excess of six, so a bid must be between one (seven tricks) and seven (thirteen tricks).  A bid is higher than another bid if either the level is greater (e.g., 2 over 1NT) or the denomination is higher, with the order being in ascending order: , , , , and NT (no trump).  Calls may be made orally, or with a bidding box, or digitally in online bridge.   If the last bid was by the opposing partnership, one may also the opponents' bid, increasing the penalties for undertricks, but also increasing the reward for making the contract. \nDoubling does not carry to future bids by the opponents unless future bids are doubled again. A player on the opposing partnership being doubled may also , which increases the penalties and rewards further.  Players may not see their partner's hand during the auction, only their own.  There exist many bidding conventions that assign agreed meanings to various calls to assist players in reaching an optimal contract (or obstruct the opponents).   The auction ends when, after a player bids, doubles, or redoubles, every other player has passed, in which case the action proceeds to the play; or every player has passed and no bid has been made, in which case the round is considered to be \"passed out\" and not played.   Section::::Gameplay.:Play.   The player from the declaring side who first bid the denomination named in the final contract becomes declarer.  The player left to the declarer leads to the first trick.  Then the dummy lays his or her cards face up on the table.  Play proceeds clockwise, with each player required to follow suit if possible.  Tricks are won by the highest trump, or if there were none played, the highest card of the led suit.  The player who won the previous trick leads to the next trick. \nThe declarer has control of the dummy's cards and plays them when it is their turn, although the declarer often requests his partner to play a specified card on his behalf. There also exist conventions that communicate further information between defenders about their hands during the play.   At any time, a player may , stating that their side will win a specific number of the remaining tricks.  The claiming player lays his cards down on the table explains how he intends to play the remaining cards.  The opponents can either accept the claim and the round is scored accordingly, or dispute the claim.  If the claim is disputed, play continues with the claiming player's cards face up in rubber games, or in duplicate games, play ceases and the tournament director is called to adjudicate the hand.   Section::::Gameplay.:Scoring.   At the end of the hand, points are awarded to the declaring side if they make the contract, or else to the defenders.  Partnerships can be , increasing the rewards for making the contract, but also increasing the penalties for undertricks.  In rubber bridge, if a side has won 100 contract points, they have won a and are vulnerable for the remaining rounds, but in duplicate bridge, vulnerability is predetermined based on the number of each board. \n If the declaring side makes their contract, they receive points for , or tricks bid and made in excess of six. In both rubber and duplicate bridge, the declaring side is awarded 20 points per odd trick for a contract in clubs or diamonds, and 30 points per odd trick for a contract in hearts or spades.  For a contract in notrump, the declaring side is awarded 40 points for the first odd trick and 30 points for the remaining odd tricks.  Contract points are doubled or quadrupled if the contract is respectively doubled or redoubled.   In rubber bridge, a partnership wins one game once it has accumulated 100 contract points; excess contract points do not carry over to the next game.  A partnership that wins two games wins the rubber, receiving a bonus of 500 points if the opponents have won a game, and 700 points if they have not.   Overtricks score the same number of points per odd trick, although their doubled and redoubled values differ.  Bonuses vary between the two bridge variations both in score and in type (for example, rubber bridge awards a bonus for holding a certain combination of high cards), although some are common between the two. \n A larger bonus is awarded if the declaring side makes a small slam or grand slam, a contract of 12 or 13 tricks respectively. If the declaring side is not vulnerable, a small slam gets 500 points, and a grand slam 1000 points.  If the declaring side is vulnerable, a small slam is 750 points and a grand slam is 1,500.   In rubber bridge, the rubber finishes when a partnership has won two games, but the partnership receiving the most \"overall\" points wins the rubber.  Duplicate bridge is scored comparatively, meaning that the score for the hand is compared to other tables playing the same cards and match points are scored according to the comparative results: usually either \"matchpoint scoring\", where each partnership receives 2 points (or 1 point) for each pair that they beat, and 1 point (or point) for each tie; or IMPs (international matchpoint) scoring, where the number of IMPs varies (but less than proportionately) with the points difference between the teams.   Undertricks are scored in both variations as follows:  Section::::Rules.   The rules of the game are referred to as the \"laws\" as promulgated by various bridge organizations.   Section::::Rules.:Laws of duplicate bridge. \n The official rules of duplicate bridge are promulgated by the WBF as \"The Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2017\". The Laws Committee of the WBF, composed of world experts, updates the Laws every 10 years; it also issues a Laws Commentary advising on interpretations it has rendered.   In addition to the basic rules of play, there are many additional rules covering playing conditions and the rectification of irregularities, which are primarily for use by tournament directors who act as referees and have overall control of procedures during competitions.  But various details of procedure are left to the discretion of the zonal bridge organisation for tournaments under their aegis and some (for example, the choice of \"movement\") to the sponsoring organisation (for example, the club).   Some zonal organisations of the WBF also publish editions of the Laws.  For example, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) publishes the \"Laws of Duplicate Bridge\" and additional documentation for club and tournament directors.   Section::::Rules.:Rules of rubber bridge.   There are no universally accepted rules for rubber bridge, but some zonal organisations have published their own.  An example for those wishing to abide by a published standard is \"The Laws of Rubber Bridge\" as published by the American Contract Bridge League. \n The majority of rules mirror those of duplicate bridge in the bidding and play and differ primarily in procedures for dealing and scoring.  Section::::Rules.:Laws of online play.   In 2001, the WBF promulgated a set of Laws for online play.   Section::::History.   Bridge is a member of the family of trick-taking games and is a development of Whist, which had become the dominant such game and enjoyed a loyal following for centuries.  According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Bridge\" is the English pronunciation of a game called \"Biritch\", which was also known as Russian Whist.   However, the idea of a trick-taking 52-card game has its first documented origins in Italy and France.  The French physician and author Rabelais (1493–1553) mentions a game called \"La Triomphe\" in one of his works.  In 1526 the Italian Francesco Berni wrote the oldest known (as of 1960) textbook on a game very similar to Whist, known as \"Triomfi\".  Also, a Spanish textbook in Latin from the first half of the 16th century, \"Triumphens Historicus\", deals with the same subject.   The oldest known Biritch rule book, dated 1886, is \"\" by John Collinson. \nIt and his subsequent letter to \"The Saturday Review\" dated May 28, 1906, document the origin of \"Biritch\" as being the Russian community in Istanbul. It has some features in common with Solo Whist.  The game had many significant bridge-like developments: dealer chose the trump suit, or nominated his partner to do so; there was a call of no trumps (\"biritch\"); dealer's partner's hand became dummy; points were scored above and below the line; game was 3NT, 4 and 5 (although 8 club odd tricks and 15 spade odd tricks were needed); the score could be doubled and redoubled; and there were slam bonuses.  This game, and variants of it known as \"bridge\" and \"bridge-whist\", became popular in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1890s despite the long-established dominance of whist.   In 1904 auction bridge was developed, in which the players bid in a competitive auction to decide the contract and declarer.  The object became to make at least as many tricks as were contracted for, and penalties were introduced for failing to do so.  Auction bridge bidding beyond winning the auction is pointless. \nIf taking all 13 tricks, there is no difference in score between a 1 and a 7 final bid, as no bonus for game, small slam or grand slam exists.  The modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to the scoring of auction bridge by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and others.  The most significant change was that only the tricks contracted for were scored below the line toward game or a slam bonus, a change that resulted in bidding becoming much more challenging and interesting.  Also new was the concept of \"vulnerability\", making sacrifices to protect the lead in a rubber more expensive.  The various scores were adjusted to produce a more balanced and interesting game.  Vanderbilt set out his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had so supplanted other forms of the game that \"bridge\" became synonymous with \"contract bridge\".   In the US and many other countries, most of the bridge played today is duplicate bridge, which is played at clubs, in tournaments and online.  The number of people playing contract bridge has declined since its peak in the 1940s, when a survey found it was played in 44% of US households. \nThe game is still widely played, especially amongst retirees, and in 2005 the ACBL estimated there were 25 million players in the US.  Section::::Tournaments.   Bridge is a game of skill played with randomly dealt cards, which makes it also a game of chance, or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication.  The chance element is in the deal of the cards; in duplicate bridge some of the chance element is eliminated by comparing results of multiple pairs in identical situations.  This is achievable when there are eight or more players, sitting at two or more tables, and the deals from each table are preserved and passed to the next table, thereby \"duplicating\" them for the other table(s) of players.  At the end of a session, the scores for each deal are compared, and the most points are awarded to the players doing the best with each particular deal.  This measures relative skill (but still with an element of luck) because each pair or team is being judged only on the ability to bid with, and play, the same cards as other players.   Duplicate bridge is played in clubs and tournaments, which can gather as many as several hundred players. \nDuplicate bridge is a mind sport, and its popularity gradually became comparable to that of chess, with which it is often compared for its complexity and the mental skills required for high-level competition. Bridge and chess are the only \"mind sports\" recognized by the International Olympic Committee, although they were not found eligible for the main Olympic program.  In October 2017 the British High Court ruled against the English Bridge Union, finding that Bridge is not a sport under a definition of sport as involving physical activity, but did not rule on the \"broad, somewhat philosophical question\" as to whether or not bridge is a sport.   The basic premise of duplicate bridge had previously been used for whist matches as early as 1857.  Initially, bridge was not thought to be suitable for duplicate competition; it was not until the 1920s that (auction) bridge tournaments became popular.   In 1925 when contract bridge first evolved, bridge tournaments were becoming popular, but the rules were somewhat in flux, and several different organizing bodies were involved in tournament sponsorship: the American Bridge League (formerly the \"American Auction Bridge League\", which changed its name in 1929), the American Whist League, and the United States Bridge Association.  In 1935, the first officially recognized world championship was held. \nBy 1937, however, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) had come to power (a union of the ABL and the USBA), and it remains the sanctioning body for bridge tournaments in North America. In 1958, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) was founded to promote bridge worldwide, coordinate periodic revision to the Laws (each ten years, next in 2017) and conduct world championships.   Section::::Tournaments.:Bidding boxes and bidding screens.   In tournaments, \"bidding boxes\" are frequently used, as noted above.  These avoid the possibility of players at other tables hearing any spoken bids.  The bidding cards are laid out in sequence as the auction progresses.  Although it is not a formal rule, many clubs adopt a protocol that the bidding cards stay revealed until the first playing card is tabled, after which point the bidding cards are put away.   In top national and international events, \"bidding screens\" are used.  These are placed diagonally across the table, preventing partners from seeing each other during the game; often the screen is removed after the auction is complete.   Section::::Game strategy.   Section::::Game strategy.:Bidding.   Much of the complexity in bridge arises from the difficulty of arriving at a good final contract in the auction (or deciding to let the opponents declare the contract). \nThis is a difficult problem: the two players in a partnership must try to communicate enough information about their hands to arrive at a makeable contract, but the information they can exchange is restricted – information may be passed only by the calls made and later by the cards played, not by other means; in addition, the agreed-upon meaning of each call and play must be available to the opponents.  Since a partnership that has freedom to bid gradually at leisure can exchange more information, and since a partnership that can interfere with the opponents' bidding (as by raising the bidding level rapidly) can cause difficulties for their opponents, bidding systems are both informational and strategic.  It is this mixture of information exchange and evaluation, deduction, and tactics that is at the heart of bidding in bridge.   A number of basic rules of thumb in bridge bidding and play are summarized as bridge maxims.   Section::::Game strategy.:Bidding.:Bidding systems and conventions.   A \"bidding system\" is a set of partnership agreements on the meanings of bids.  A partnership's bidding system is usually made up of a core system, modified and complemented by specific conventions (optional customizations incorporated into the main system for handling specific bidding situations) which are pre-chosen between the partners prior to play. \nThe line between a well-known convention and a part of a system is not always clear-cut: some bidding systems include specified conventions by default. Bidding systems can be divided into mainly natural systems such as Acol and Standard American, and mainly artificial systems such as the Precision Club and Polish Club.  Calls are usually considered to be either \"natural\" or \"conventional\" (artificial).  A natural call carries a meaning that reflects the call; a natural bid intuitively showing hand or suit strength based on the level or suit of the bid, and a natural double expressing that the player believes that the opposing partnership will not make their contract.  By contrast, a conventional (artificial) call offers and/or asks for information by means of pre-agreed coded interpretations, in which some calls convey very specific information or requests that are not part of the natural meaning of the call.  Thus in response to 4NT, a 'natural' bid of 5 would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play the contract in 5 diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common Blackwood convention, a bid of 5 in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace. \n Conventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by adopting a conventional (artificial) meaning for a given call where a natural meaning would have less utility, because the information it would convey is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information would arise only rarely. The conventional meaning conveys more useful (or more frequently useful) information.  There are a very large number of conventions from which players can choose; many books have been written detailing bidding conventions.  Well-known conventions include Stayman (to ask the opening 1NT bidder to show any four-card major suit), Jacoby transfers (a request by (usually) the weak hand for the partner to bid a particular suit first, and therefore to become the declarer), and the Blackwood convention (to ask for information on the number of aces and kings held, used in slam bidding situations).   The term \"preempt\" refers to a high-level tactical bid by a weak hand, relying upon a very long suit rather than high cards for tricks. \nPreemptive bids serve a double purpose – they allow players to indicate they are bidding on the basis of a long suit in an otherwise weak hand, which is important information to share, and they also consume substantial bidding space which prevents a possibly strong opposing pair from exchanging information on their cards. Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.   Section::::Game strategy.:Bidding.:Basic natural systems.   As a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.   Most systems use a count of high card points as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate.  In the most commonly used point count system, aces are counted as 4 points, kings as 3, queens as 2, and jacks as 1 point; therefore, the deck contains 40 points. \nIn addition, the \"distribution\" of the cards in a hand into suits may also contribute to the strength of a hand and be counted as distribution points. A better than average hand, containing 12 or 13 points, is usually considered sufficient to \"open\" the bidding, i.e., to make the first bid in the auction.  A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a major suit or notrump (more are usually needed for a minor suit game, as the level is higher).   In natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18 – the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points (for example, 12–14, 15–17 or 16–18), but some systems use a four-point range, usually 15–18. \n Opening bids of three or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand's value quickly and to frustrate the opposition. For example, a hand of would be a candidate for an opening bid of 3, designed to make it difficult for the opposing team to bid and find their optimum contract even if they have the bulk of the points, as it is nearly valueless unless spades are trumps, it contains good enough spades that the penalty for being set should not be higher than the value of an opponent game, and the high card weakness makes it more likely that the opponents have enough strength to make game themselves.   Openings at the 2 level are either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2, artificial) or preemptive, depending on the system.  Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more).  Also 2 as the strongest (by HCP and by DP+HCP) has become more common, perhaps especially at websites that offer duplicate bridge. \nHere the 2 opening is used for either hands with a good 6-card suit or longer (max one losing card) and a total of 18 HCP up to 23 total points – or \"NT\", like 2NT but with 22–23 HCP. Whilst the 2 opening bid takes care of all hands with 24 points (HCP or with distribution points included) with the only exception of \"Gambling 3NT\".   Opening bids at the one level are made with hands containing 12–13 points or more and which are not suitable for one of the preceding bids.  Using Standard American with 5-card majors, opening hearts or spades usually promises a 5-card suit.  Partnerships who agree to play 5-card majors open a minor suit with 4-card majors and then bid their major suit at the next opportunity.  This means that an opening bid of 1 or 1 will sometimes be made with only 3 cards in that suit.   Doubles are sometimes given conventional meanings in otherwise mostly natural systems.  A natural, or \"penalty\" double, is one used to try to gain extra points when the defenders are confident of setting (defeating) the contract. \nThe most common example of a conventional double is the takeout double of a low-level suit bid, implying support for the unbid suits or the unbid major suits and asking partner to choose one of them.  Section::::Game strategy.:Bidding.:Variations on the basic themes.   Bidding systems depart from these basic ideas in varying degrees.  Standard American, for instance, is a collection of conventions designed to bolster the accuracy and power of these basic ideas, while Precision Club is a system that uses the 1 opening bid for all or almost all strong hands (but sets the threshold for \"strong\" rather lower than most other systems – usually 16 high card points) and may include other artificial calls to handle other situations (but it may contain natural calls as well).  Many experts today use a system called 2/1 game forcing (enunciated as two over one game forcing), which amongst other features adds some complexity to the treatment of the one notrump response as used in Standard American.  In the UK, Acol is the most common system; its main features are a weak one notrump opening with 12–14 high card points and several variations for 2-level openings.   There are also a variety of advanced techniques used for hand evaluation. \nThe most basic is the Milton Work point count, (the 4-3-2-1 system detailed above) but this is sometimes modified in various ways, or either augmented or replaced by other approaches such as losing trick count, honor point count, law of total tricks, or Zar Points.  Common conventions and variations within natural systems include:  BULLET::::- Point count required for 1 NT opening bid ('mini' 10–12, 'weak' 12–14, 'strong' 15–17 or 16–18)  BULLET::::- Whether an opening bid of 1 and 1 requires a minimum of 4 or 5 cards in the suit (\"4 or 5 card majors\")  BULLET::::- Whether 1 (and sometimes 1) is 'natural' or 'suspect' \"(also called 'phoney' or 'short')\", signifying an opening hand lacking a notable heart or spade suit  BULLET::::- Whether opening bids at the two level are 'strong' (20+ points) or 'weak' (i.e., pre-emptive with a 6 card suit). \n(Note: an opening bid of 2 is usually played in otherwise natural systems as conventional, signifying any exceptionally strong hand)  BULLET::::- \"Blackwood\" (either the original version or \"Roman Key Card\")  BULLET::::- \"Stayman\" (together with Blackwood, described as \"the two most famous conventions in Bridge\".)  BULLET::::- Whether the partnership will play \"Jacoby transfers\" (bids of 2 and 2 over 1NT or 3 and 3 over 2NT respectively require the 1NT or 2NT bidder to rebid 2 and 2 or 3 and 3), \"minor suit transfers\" (bids of 2 and either 2NT or 3 over 1NT respectively require the 1NT bidder to bid 3 and 3) and \"Texas transfers\" (bids of 4 and 4 respectively require the 1NT, or 2NT bidder to rebid 4 and 4)  BULLET::::- What types of \"cue bids (e.g. bidding the opponents' suit)\" the partnership will play, if any.   BULLET::::- Whether doubling a contract at the 1, 2 and sometimes higher levels signifies a belief that the opponents' contract will fail and a desire to raise the stakes (a \"penalty double\"), or an indication of strength but no biddable suit coupled with a request that partner bid something (a \"takeout double\"). \n BULLET::::- Whether doubling or overcalling over opponents' 1NT is natural or conventional. One common artificial agreement is Cappelletti, where 2 is a transfer to be passed or corrected to a major, 2 means both majors and a major shows that suit plus a minor.   BULLET::::- How the partnership's bidding practices will be varied if their opponents intervene or compete.   BULLET::::- Which (if any) bids are \"forcing\" and require a response.   Within play, it is also commonly agreed what systems of opening leads, signals and discards will be played:  BULLET::::- Conventions for the opening lead govern how the first card to be played will be chosen and what it will mean,  BULLET::::- Signals indicate how cards played within a suit are chosen – for example, playing a noticeably high card when this would not be expected can signal encouragement to continue playing the suit, and a low card can signal discouragement and a desire for partner to choose some other suit.  (Some partnerships use \"reverse\" signals, meaning that a noticeably high card \"discourages\" that suit and a noticeably low card \"encourages\" that suit, thus not \"wasting\" a potentially useful intermediate card in the suit of interest.) \n BULLET::::- Discards cover the situation when a defender cannot follow suit and therefore has free choice what card to play or throw away. In such circumstances the thrown-away card can be used to indicate some aspect of the hand, or a desire for a specific suit to be played.   BULLET::::- Count signals cover the situation when a defender is following suit (usually to a suit that the declarer has led).  In such circumstances the order in which a defender plays his spot cards will indicate whether an even or odd number of cards was originally held in that suit.  This can help the other defender count out the entire original distribution of the cards in that suit.  It is sometimes critical to know this when defending.   BULLET::::- Suit preference signals cover the situation where a defender is returning a suit which will be ruffed by his partner.  If he plays a high card he is showing an entry in the higher side suit and vice versa.  There are some other situations where this tool may be used.   BULLET::::- Surrogate signals cover the situation when it is critical to show length in a side suit and it will be too late if defenders wait until that suit is played. \nThen, the play in the first declarer played suit is a count signal regarding the critical suit and not the trump suit itself. In fact, any signal made about a suit in another suit might be called as such.   Section::::Game strategy.:Bidding.:Advanced bidding techniques.   Every call (including \"pass\", also sometimes called \"no bid\") serves two purposes.  It confirms or passes some information to a partner, and also denies by implication any other kind of hand which would have tended to support an alternative call.  For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner's 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also would almost always deny possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player would probably have used the Stayman convention). \n Likewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2 in the sequence 1NT–2–2–2 between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2 denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit). Thus an astute partner can read much more than the surface meaning into the bidding.  Alternatively, many partnerships play this same bidding sequence as \"Crawling Stayman\" by which the responder shows a weak hand (less than eight high card points) with shortness in diamonds but at least four hearts and four spades; the opening bidder may correct to spades if that appears to be the better contract.   The situations detailed here are extremely simple examples; many instances of advanced bidding involve specific agreements related to very specific situations and subtle inferences regarding entire sequences of calls.   Section::::Game strategy.:Play techniques. \n Terence Reese, a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:  BULLET::::- playing a high card that no one else can beat  BULLET::::- trumping an opponent's high card  BULLET::::- establishing long suits (the last cards in a suit will take tricks if the opponents don't have the suit and are unable to trump)  BULLET::::- playing for the opponents' high cards to be in a particular position (if their ace is to the right of your king, your king may be able to take a trick, especially if, when that suit is led, the player to your right has to play their card before you do)  Nearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods. The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience and is the subject of whole books on bridge.   Section::::Example.   The cards are dealt as shown in the bridge hand diagram; North is the dealer and starts the auction which proceeds as shown in the bidding table.   As neither North nor East have sufficient strength to \"open\" the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. \nSouth, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the bidding system) and at least 12 high card points. On this hand, South has 14 high card points.  West \"overcalls\" with 1, since he has a long spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid).  North \"supports\" partner's suit with 2, showing heart support and about points.  East supports spades with 2. South inserts a \"game try\" of 3, \"inviting\" the partner to bid the \"game\" of 4 with good club support and overall values.  North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2 bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2 bid promised only three), and the \"doubleton\" queen of clubs to fit with partner's strength there.  (North could instead have bid 3, indicating not enough strength for game, asking South to pass and so play 3.) \n In the auction, North-South are trying to investigate whether their cards are sufficient to make a game (nine tricks at notrump, ten tricks in hearts or spades, 11 tricks in clubs or diamonds), which yields bonus points if bid and made. East-West are \"competing\" in spades, hoping to play a contract in spades at a low level.  4 is the final contract, 10 tricks being required for N-S to make with hearts as trump.   South is the \"declarer\", having been first to bid hearts, and the player to South's left, West, has to choose the first card in the play, known as the \"opening lead\".  West chooses the spade king because spades is the suit the partnership has shown strength in, and because they have agreed that when they hold two \"touching honors\" (or \"adjacent honors\") they will play the higher one first.  West plays the card face down, to give their partner and the declarer (but not dummy) a chance to ask any last questions about the bidding or to object if they believe West is not the correct hand to lead. \nAfter that, North's cards are laid on the table and North becomes \"dummy\", as both the North and South hands will be controlled by the declarer. West turns the lead card face up, and the declarer studies the two hands to make a plan for the play.  On this hand, the trump ace, a spade, and a diamond trick must be lost, so declarer must not lose a trick in clubs.   If the K is held by West, South will find it very hard to prevent it from making a trick (unless West leads a club).  However, there is an almost-equal chance that it is held by East, in which case it can be 'trapped' against the ace, and will be beaten, using a tactic known as a \"finesse\".   After considering the cards, the declarer directs dummy (North) to play a small spade.  East plays \"low\" (small card) and South takes the A, gaining the \"lead\".  (South may also elect to \"duck\", but for the purpose of this example, let us assume South wins the A at trick 1). \nSouth proceeds by \"drawing trump\", leading the K. West decides there is no benefit to holding back, and so wins the trick with the ace, and then cashes the Q. For fear of conceding a \"ruff and discard\", West plays the 2 instead of another spade. Declarer plays low from the table, and East scores the Q. Not having anything better to do, East returns the remaining trump, taken in South's hand.  The trumps now accounted for, South can now execute the finesse, perhaps trapping the king as planned.  South \"enters\" the dummy (i.e. wins a trick in the dummy's hand) by leading a low diamond, using dummy's A to win the trick, and leads the Q from dummy to the next trick.  East \"covers\" the queen with the king, and South takes the trick with the ace, and proceeds by \"cashing\" the remaining \"master\" J. (If East doesn't play the king, then South will play a low club from South's hand and the queen will win anyway, this being the essence of the finesse). \nThe game is now safe: South \"ruffs\" a small club with a dummy's trump, then ruffs a diamond in hand for an \"entry\" back, and ruffs the last club in dummy (sometimes described as a \"crossruff\"). Finally, South \"claims\" the remaining tricks by showing his or her hand, as it now contains only high trumps and there's no need to play the hand out to prove they are all winners.   (The trick-by-trick notation used above can be also expressed in tabular form, but a textual explanation is usually preferred in practice, for reader's convenience.  Plays of small cards or \"discards\" are often omitted from such a description, unless they were important for the outcome).   North-South score the required 10 tricks, and their opponents take the remaining three.  The contract is fulfilled, and North enters the pair numbers, the contract, and the score of +420 for the winning side (North is in charge of bookkeeping in duplicate tournaments) on the traveling sheet.  North asks East to check the score entered on the traveller.  All players return their own cards to the board, and the next deal is played. \n On the prior hand, it is quite possible that the K is held by West. For example, by swapping the K and A between the defending hands.  Then the 4 contract would fail by one trick (unless West had led a club early in the play).  However the failure of the contract would not mean that 4 is a bad contract on this hand.  The contract depends on the club finesse working, or a mis-defense.  The bonus points awarded for making a game contract far outweigh the penalty for going one off, so it is best strategy in the long run to bid game contracts such as this one.   Similarly, there is a minuscule chance that the K is in the west hand, but the west hand has no other clubs.  In that case, declarer can succeed by simply cashing the A, felling the K and setting up the Q as a winner.  However the chance of this is far lower than the simple chance of approximately 50% that East started with the K. Therefore, the superior \"percentage\" play is to take the club finesse, as described above.   Section::::Computer bridge.   Section::::Computer bridge.:User-based play.   After many years of little progress, computer bridge made great progress at the end of the 20th century. \nIn 1996, the ACBL initiated official World Championships Computer Bridge, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first Computer Bridge Championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in Albuquerque, New Mexico.   Strong bridge playing programs such as Jack (World Champion in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009), Wbridge5 (World Champion in 2005, 2007 and 2008), RoboBridge and many-time finalist Bridge Baron, would probably rank among the top few thousand human pairs worldwide.  A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine IMP describes matches between Jack and seven top Dutch pairs.  A total of 196 boards were played.  Overall, the program Jack lost, but by a small margin (359 versus 385 imps).   Section::::Computer bridge.:Internet-based play.   There are several free and subscription-based services available for playing bridge on the internet.  For example:  BULLET::::- OKbridge is the oldest of the still-running internet bridge services: was established as a commercial enterprise in 1994, but the program started to be used interactively in August 1990 on players of all standards.  Beginners to world class may be found playing there. \nOKbridge is a subscription-based club, with services such as customer support and ethics reviews.  BULLET::::- SWAN Games was founded April, 2000.  In March 2004, announced a partnership to provide internet services to SBF members and is a competitor in subscription-based online bridge clubs.   BULLET::::- Bridge Base Online (BBO) is the most active online bridge club in the world, with more than 100 000 daily connections and 500 000 hands played each day, in part because it is free to play regular games and volunteer-run tournaments.   Some national contract bridge organizations now offer online bridge play to their members, including the English Bridge Union, the Dutch Bridge Federation and the Australian Bridge Federation.  MSN and Yahoo!  Games have several online rubber bridge rooms.  In 2001, the WBF issued a special edition of the lawbook adapted for internet and other electronic forms of the game.

{"id":"KILT_5760445","text":" Tesla Roadster (2008)  The Tesla Roadster is a battery electric vehicle (BEV) sports car, based on the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced by the electric car firm Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) in California from 2008 to 2012.  The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than per charge.  It is also the first production car to be launched into orbit, carried by a Falcon Heavy rocket in a test flight on February 6, 2018.   Tesla sold about 2,450 Roadsters in over 30 countries, and most of the last Roadsters were sold in Europe and Asia during the fourth quarter of 2012.  Tesla produced right-hand-drive Roadsters from early 2010.  The Roadster qualified for government incentives in several nations.   The world distance record of for a production electric car on a single charge was set by a Roadster on October 27, 2009, during the Global Green Challenge in outback Australia, in which it averaged a speed of . \nIn March 2010, a Tesla Roadster became the first electric vehicle to win the Monte Carlo Alternative Energy Rally and the first to win any Federation Internationale de l'Automobile-sanctioned championship when a Roadster driven by former Formula One driver Érik Comas beat 96 competitors for range, efficiency and performance in the three-day, nearly challenge.  According to the U.S. EPA, the Roadster can travel on a single charge of its lithium-ion battery pack, and can accelerate from in 3.7 or 3.9 seconds depending on the model.  It has a top speed of .  The Roadster's efficiency, , was reported as 120 MPGe (2.0 L/100 km).  It uses 135 Wh/km (21.7 kW·h/100 mi, 13.5 kW·h/100 km or 490 kJ/km) battery-to-wheel, and has an efficiency of 88% on average.   Section::::History.   Prototypes of the car were officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.   The San Francisco International Auto Show, held on November 18–26, 2006, was the Tesla Roadster's first auto show. \n It was featured in \"Time\" in December 2006 as the recipient of the magazine's \"Best Inventions 2006—Transportation Invention\" award. The first \"Signature One Hundred\" set of fully equipped Roadsters sold out in less than three weeks, the second hundred sold out by October 2007 and general production began on March 17, 2008.   The first Tesla Roadster was delivered in February 2008 to Tesla co-founder, chairman and product architect Elon Musk.  The company produced 500 similar vehicles through June 2009.  In July 2009, Tesla began production of its 2010 model-year Roadster—the first major product upgrade.  Simultaneously, Tesla began producing the Roadster Sport, the first derivative of Tesla's proprietary, patented powertrain.  The car accelerates from in 3.7 seconds, compared to 3.9 seconds for the standard Roadster.  Changes for the 2010 model-year cars included:  BULLET::::- An upgraded interior and push-button gear selector, including \"executive interior\" of exposed carbon fiber and premium leather, and clear-coat carbon fiber body accents.   BULLET::::- Locking, push-button glove box wrapped in leather.   BULLET::::- A centrally mounted video display screen to monitor real-time data, including estimated range, power regenerated, and the number of barrels of oil saved. \nThis screen is visible to the driver and passenger.  BULLET::::- Adjustable, custom-tuned suspension.  The shock absorbers' response and anti-sway bars are manually adjustable.   BULLET::::- More powerful and immediate heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.   BULLET::::- More efficient motor and hand-wound stator.  The increase in efficiency allows the motor to deliver higher peak power.   BULLET::::- A suite of sound-deadening measures to dramatically reduce noise, vibration and harshness.  For instance, engineers added pellets to a member of the chassis side rail.  These pellets expand by 50 times original volume during the adhesive heating cycle to eliminate rattles.   All of these features, except for the motor were available either as standard or as add-on option for the non-sport model.   Beginning mid-March 2010, Tesla, in an effort to show off the practicality of its electric cars, sent one of its Roadsters around the world.  Starting at the Geneva auto show, the Roadster completed its journey upon its arrival in Paris on September 28, 2010.   In July 2010, Tesla introduced the \"Roadster 2.5\", the latest update of the Roadster. \nNew features in Roadster 2.5 include:  BULLET::::- A new look, which included a new front fascia with diffusing vents, and rear diffuser reflecting the future of Tesla design  BULLET::::- Directional forged wheels available in both silver and black  BULLET::::- New seats with improved comfort, larger more supportive bolsters and a new lumbar support system  BULLET::::- Power control hardware that enables spirited driving in exceptionally hot climates  BULLET::::- An optional 7\" touchscreen display with back-up camera  BULLET::::- Improved interior sound reduction including new front fender liner material to make the cabin quieter  At the time, the US$112,000 Roadster was the most expensive single prize ever offered, though not won, on \"The Price Is Right\", in a playing of Golden Road on April 22, 2010 for Earth Day.  A Roadster was used as a promotional tool for a wind power electricity company in 2012.   Tesla produced the Roadster until January 2012, when its supply of Lotus gliders ran out, as its contract with Lotus Cars for 2,500 gliders expired at the end of 2011.  Tesla stopped taking orders for the Roadster in the U.S. market in August 2011. \nThe next generation will not be based on the Lotus gliders but instead on a shortened version of the architecture developed for the Tesla Model S. Featuring new options and enhanced components, the 2012 Tesla Roadster was sold in limited numbers only in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tesla's U.S. exemption for not having special two-stage passenger airbags expired for cars made after the end of 2011 so the last Roadsters could not be sold in the American market.  Also a total of 15 Final Edition Roadsters were produced to close the manufacturing cycle of Tesla's first electric car.  the Roadster remained on sale in Europe and Asia and , inventories were not yet depleted.   Tesla announced an optional upgrade to current Roadsters, the Roadster 3.0 in December 2014.  It will have a new battery pack from LG Chem, with capacity increased by 50% to , a new aero kit designed to reduce drag, and new tires with lower rolling resistance.   Section::::Development.   The Roadster was developed by Tesla to mass-produce AC Propulsion's tzero concept car.   After Martin Eberhard sold NuvoMedia to TV Guide, he wanted a sports car with high mileage, but could not find one.  His battery experience with the Rocket eBook inspired him to develop an electric car. \nThe production idea was conceived by Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning who incorporated Tesla Motors in Delaware on July 1, 2003, to pursue the idea commercially. South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk took an active role within the company starting in 2004, including investing US$7.5 million, overseeing Roadster product design from the beginning, and greatly expanding Tesla's long-term strategic sales goals by using the sports car to fund development of mainstream vehicles.  Musk became Tesla's Chairman of the Board in April 2004 and had helped recruit JB Straubel as chief technology officer in March 2004.  Musk received the Global Green 2006 product design award for the design of the Tesla Roadster, presented by Mikhail Gorbachev, and he received the 2007 Index Design award for the design of the Tesla Roadster.   Before Tesla had developed the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an AC Propulsion Tzero vehicle as a test mule and converted from lead acid AGM batteries to lithium ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance.  Tesla then licensed AC Propulsion's EV power system design and reductive charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the inverter, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost.  However, Tesla was dissatisfied with how the motor and transmission worked in the chassis. \nTesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from AC Propulsion. Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion.  The Roadster's powertrain is unique.   On 11 July 2005, Tesla and British sports car maker Lotus entered an agreement about products and services based on the Lotus Elise, where Lotus provided advice on designing and developing a vehicle as well as producing partly assembled vehicles, and amended in 2009, helped with basic chassis development.  The Roadster has a parts overlap of roughly 6% with the Lotus Elise, a 2-inch-longer wheelbase, and a slightly stiffer chassis according to Eberhard.  Tesla's designers chose to construct the body panels using resin transfer molded carbon fiber composite to minimize weight; this choice makes the Roadster one of the least expensive cars with an entirely carbon fiber skin.   Several prototypes of the Tesla Roadster were produced from 2004 through 2007.  Initial studies were done in two \"test mule\" vehicles based on Lotus Elises equipped with all-electric drive systems.  Ten engineering prototypes (EP1 through EP10) which led to many minor changes were then built and tested in late 2006 and early 2007. \nTesla then produced at least 26 validation prototypes which were delivered beginning in March 2007. These final revisions were endurance and crash tested in preparation for series production.   In August 2007, Martin Eberhard was replaced by an interim CEO, Michael Marks.  Marks accepted the temporary position while a recruitment was undertaken.  In December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became the CEO and president of Tesla.  In October 2008, Musk succeeded Drori as CEO.  Drori became vice chairman and left the company in December.  In January 2008, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it would grant a waiver of the \"advanced\" air bag rule noting that the Tesla Roadster already includes standard air bags; similar waivers have been granted to many other small volume manufacturers as well, including Lotus, Ferrari, and Bugatti.  Tesla delivered its first production car in February 2008 to Musk.   Tesla announced in early August 2009 that Roadster sales had resulted in overall corporate profitability for the month of July 2009, earning on revenue of .   Tesla, which signed a production contract with Group Lotus in 2007 to produce \"gliders\" (complete cars minus electric powertrain) for the Roadster, announced in early 2010 that Roadster production would continue until early 2012. \nStarting one year prior to the end of the contract, Tesla put a hiatus on new orders to allow time for tooling changes at Lotus's assembly plant in the UK.  Section::::Production.   Tesla's cumulative production of the Roadster reached 1,000 cars in January 2010.  The Roadster is considered an American car though many carry a Vehicle Identification Number beginning with the letter \"S\" which is the designation for the United Kingdom.  Some however carry a number starting with \"5\" appropriate to the US.  Parts were sourced from around the world.  The body panels came from French supplier Sotira.  These were sent from France to Hethel, U.K., where Tesla contracted with Lotus to build the Roadster's unique chassis.  The Roadster shares roughly 6% of its components with the Lotus Elise; shared components include the windshield, air bags, some tires, some dashboard parts, and suspension components.  The Roadster's single-speed gearbox was made in Detroit to Tesla's specifications by Auburn Hills, Michigan-based supplier BorgWarner.  Brakes and airbags were made by Siemens in Germany, and some crash testing was conducted at Siemens as well.   For Roadsters bound for customers in North America, the chassis was then sent to Menlo Park, California, for final assembly. \nFor Roadsters bound for customers in Europe or elsewhere outside of North America, the chassis was sent to a facility at Wymondham near Hethel, for final assembly. At these final assembly locations, Tesla employees installed the entire powertrain, which consisted of the battery pack, power electronics module, gearbox and motor.  Tesla also performed rigorous \"pre-delivery inspection\" on every car before customers took ownership.   Tesla ordered 2,500 gliders from Lotus, which ended supplies in December 2011 when their contract expired.  Tesla ended production of the Roadster in January 2012.   Section::::Production.:Timeline.  Subsequent to completion of production car number one at Hethel, the company announced problems with transmission reliability.  The development transmission, with first gear enabled to accelerate in 4 seconds, was reported to have a life expectancy of as low as only a few thousand miles.  Tesla's first two transmission suppliers were unable to produce transmissions, in quantity, that could withstand the gear-shift requirements of the high torque, high rpm electric motor.  In December 2007, Tesla announced plans to ship the initial Roadsters with the transmissions locked into second gear to provide acceleration in 5.7 seconds.  The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. \nAccording to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available. The EPA range of the car was also restated downward from .  The downward revision was attributed to an error in equipment calibration at the laboratory that conducted the original test.   BULLET::::- During the first two months of production, Tesla produced a total of three Roadsters (P3/VINF002, P4/VINF004, and P5/VINF005).  Production car # 1 (P1) and P2 were built prior to the start of regular series production, which began March 17, 2008.   BULLET::::- By September 10, 2008, Tesla had delivered 27 of the cars to customers.  It was also reported that a newer, better transmission had been developed and that production of the car was hoped to reach 20 per week by December 2008, and 40 per week by March 2009.  Over the next 20 days, however, only three more cars had been delivered to customers which brought the total to 30 as of September 30, 2008.   BULLET::::- By November 19, 2008, more than 70 of the cars had been delivered to customers.   BULLET::::- By December 9, 2008, the 100th car had been delivered. \n BULLET::::- By February 11, 2009, 200 Roadsters had been produced.  BULLET::::- By April 2, 2009, 320 Roadsters had been delivered.   BULLET::::- In May 2009, Tesla issued a safety recall for all 345 of its Roadsters that were manufactured before April 22, 2009.  Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes to tighten the rear, inner hub flange bolts.  Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car and crash.  The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line that builds the Roadster and Lotus also recalled some of its own vehicles.  Tesla reminded customers that millions of cars are recalled every year.   BULLET::::- By the end of May 2009, the 500th Roadster had been delivered.   BULLET::::- Tesla made its first profit ever in July 2009, when it shipped 109 vehicles, the most in a single month at that time.   BULLET::::- By September 15, 2009, 700 Roadsters had been delivered.   BULLET::::- Tesla announced on January 13, 2010, that it had produced its 1,000th Roadster.  The company had delivered vehicles to customers in 43 states and 21 countries worldwide.  In 2009 Tesla began taking orders from customers in Canada, and Canadian deliveries began in February 2010. \n BULLET::::- In January 2010, Tesla began producing its first right-hand-drive Roadsters for the UK and Ireland. The 2010 model-year right-hand-drive Roadster included a suite of unique noise-reduction materials and an upgraded sound system.  The Roadster started at £86,950 and cost about 1.5p per mile.   BULLET::::- On 29 January 2010, in a Form S-1 filing of its preliminary prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company stated that it would halt production of the Roadster in 2011 and replace it with a new model which would not be introduced until 2013 at the earliest: \"...we do not plan to sell our current generation Tesla Roadster after 2011 due to planned tooling changes at a supplier for the Tesla Roadster, and we do not currently plan to begin selling our next-generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model S, which is not expected to be in production until 2012...\"  The Model S was released in June 2012.   BULLET::::- On 16 March 2010, Tesla announced that it had \"negotiated agreements with key suppliers that will increase total Roadster production by 40 percent and extend sales into 2012\", also indicating that it would expand into the Asian and Australian markets by 2011. \n BULLET::::- On 2 December 2010, Tesla had delivered more than 1,400 Roadsters.  BULLET::::- On 28 September 2011, Tesla delivered its 100th Roadster in Switzerland.   BULLET::::- Production ended in January 2012 and was no longer available for sale the U.S. after December 2011.   BULLET::::- More than 2,418 units were sold worldwide through September 2012.  The remaining cars were available for sale only in Europe and Asia.  Most of the remaining Roadsters were sold during the fourth quarter of 2012.   BULLET::::- In 2015, it was announced that a successor to the Roadster would debut in 2019.   BULLET::::- In 2016, Tesla began selling a battery upgrade from .   BULLET::::- In 2017, it was announced that a successor to the Roadster would debut in 2020.   Section::::Production.:Special final edition.   Tesla produced a special edition of 15 Final Edition Roadsters to close the production cycle of the electric car.  The 15 special-edition cars were sold in each of the three sales regions, North America, Europe and Asia, and five units were allocated to each.  The Final Edition Roadster did not have any performance modifications, but featured sporting atomic red paint, a duo of dark silver stripes on its hood and rear clamshell, and exclusive anthracite aluminum wheels.   Section::::Specifications. \n Section::::Specifications.:Motor.  The Roadster is powered by a 3-phase, 4-pole, induction electric motor with a maximum output power of . Its maximum torque of is immediately available and remains constant from 0 to 6,000 rpm; nearly instantaneous torque is a characteristic of electric motors and offers one of the biggest performance differences from internal combustion engines.  The motor is air-cooled and does not need a liquid cooling system.   The Sport model introduced during the Jan 2009 Detroit Auto Show includes a motor with a higher density, hand-wound stator that produces a maximum of .  Both motors are designed for rotational speeds of up to 14,000 rpm, and the regular motor delivers a typical efficiency of 88% or 90%; 80% at peak power.  It weighs less than .   Section::::Specifications.:Transmission.   Starting in September 2008 Tesla selected BorgWarner to manufacture gearboxes and began equipping all Roadsters with a single speed, fixed gear gearbox (8.2752:1) with an electrically actuated parking pawl mechanism and a mechanical lubrication pump.   The company previously worked with several companies, including XTrac and Magna International, to find the right automatic transmission, but a two-gear solution proved to be too challenging.  This led to substantial delays in production. \nAt the \"Town Hall Meeting\" with owners in December 2007, Tesla announced plans to ship the initial 2008 Roadsters with their interim Magna two-speed direct shift manual transmissions locked into second gear, limiting the performance of the car to less than what was originally stated ( in 5.7 seconds instead of the announced 4.0 seconds). Tesla also announced it would upgrade those transmissions under warranty when the final transmission became available.  At the \"Town Hall Meeting\" with owners on January 30, 2008, Tesla Motors described the planned transmission upgrade as a single-speed gearbox with a drive ratio of 8.27:1 combined with improved electronics and motor cooling that retain the acceleration from in under 4 seconds and an improved motor limit of 14,000 rpm to retain the top speed.  The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from and improves the Roadster's quarter mile times.   Section::::Specifications.:Transmission.:Gear selector.   In the interior the gear selector is similar to a push-button automatic with buttons labeled P, R, N and D while some earlier models have a gear lever similar to that in cars with manual transmission.   Section::::Specifications.:Performance.   The Roadster's acceleration time is 3.9 seconds for the Standard model and 3.7 seconds for the 2010 V2.5 Sport, which \"Motor Trend\" confirmed in the first independent, instrumented testing the Sport. \nThe magazine also recorded a time of 12.6 seconds at . Tesla said the top speed is electronically limited to .  Tesla claims it has a weight of , a and a .   Tesla began delivering the higher performance version of the Roadster in July 2009.  The Roadster Sport has adjustable dampers and a new hand-wound motor, capable of in 3.7 seconds.  Scotty Pollacheck, a high-performance driver for Killacycle, drove a 2010 Tesla Roadster Sport at the Wayland Invitational Drag Race in Portland, Oregon, in July 2009.  He did a quarter-mile (~400 m) in dry conditions in 12.643 seconds, setting a new record in the National Electric Drag Racing Association among the SP/A3 class of vehicles.  The combined range (specifying distance traveled between charges) measured in February 2008 for early production Roadsters was city, highway, and combined (city/highway).  In August 2008, additional testing with the newer Powertrain 1.5 resulted in an EPA combined range of .  The vehicle set a new distance record when it completed the Rallye Monte Carlo d'Energies Alternatives with left on the charge.  A Roadster drove around the world (although flying as cargo over oceans) in 2012, and repeated it in 80 days with other electric cars in 2016. \n Simon Hackett and Emilis Prelgauskas broke the distance record for an electric vehicle, driving from Alice Springs to Marla, South Australia, in Simon's Tesla Roadster. The car had about of range left when the drive was completed.   Section::::Specifications.:Battery system.   Tesla refers to the Roadster's battery pack as the Energy Storage System or ESS.  The ESS contains 6,831 lithium ion cells arranged into 11 \"sheets\" connected in series; each sheet contains 9 \"bricks\" connected in series; each \"brick\" contains 69 cells connected in parallel (11S 9S 69P).  The cells are of the 18650 form factor commonly found in laptop batteries.  Sources disagree on the exact type of Li-Ion cells—GreenCar says lithium cobalt oxide (LiCo), while researchers at DTU/INESC Porto state lithium manganese oxide (LMO).  LiCo has higher reaction energy during thermal runaway than LMO.   The pack is designed to prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells (thermal runaway), even when the cooling system is off.  Coolant is pumped continuously through the ESS both when the car is running and when the car is turned off if the pack retains more than a 90% charge.  The coolant pump draws 146 watts. \nThe cooling and battery management system keeps the temperatures and voltages within specific limits.  A full recharge to requires about 3½ hours using the High Power Connector which supplies 70-amp, 240-volt electricity.   Tesla said in February 2009 that the ESS had expected life span of seven years/, and began selling pre-purchase battery replacements for about one third of the battery's price today, with the replacement to be delivered after seven years.  Tesla says the ESS retains 70% capacity after five years and of driving, assuming driven each year.  A July 2013 study found that after , Roadster batteries still had 80%–85% capacity and the only significant factor is mileage (not temperature).   Tesla announced plans to sell the battery system to \"TH!NK\" and possibly others through its Tesla Energy Group division.  The TH!NK plans were put on hold by interim CEO Michael Marks in September 2007.  TH!NK now obtains its lithium-ion batteries from Enerdel.  Section::::Specifications.:Recharging.   The Roadster uses a proprietary charging connector, although Tesla sells a mobile adapter that enables recharging with an SAE J1772-2009 connector.  The vehicle can be recharged using:  BULLET::::- A wall-mounted 208–240 V, 70 A maximum current Home Connector. \nThis appears to be an OEM version of the TS-70 charging station from ClipperCreek.  BULLET::::- A portable 120–240 V, 40 A maximum current Universal Mobile Connector cable that can plug into a NEMA 14–50 receptacle and other 240 V receptacles using adapters.   BULLET::::- A portable 120 V, 15 A maximum current Spare Mobile Connector cable that plugs into a standard North American domestic socket.   Charging times vary depending on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available circuit breaker amp rating (current).  In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of of range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under four hours.  The slowest charging rate using a 120 V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add of range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.   Section::::Energy efficiency. \n In June 2006, Tesla reported the Roadster's battery-to-wheel efficiency as 110 W·h/km (17.7 kW·h/100 mi) on an unspecified driving cycle—either a constant ) or SAE J1634 test—and stated a charging efficiency of 86% for an overall plug-to-wheel efficiency of 128 W·h/km (20.5 kW·h/100 mi).  In March 2007, Tesla reported the Roadster's efficiency on the EPA highway cycle as \"135 mpg [  U.S.] equivalent, per the conversion rate used by the EPA\" or 133 W·h/km (21.5 kW·h/100 mi) battery-to-wheel and 155 W·h/km (24.9 kW·h/100 mi) plug-to-wheel.  The official U.S. window sticker of the 2009 Tesla Roadster showed an EPA rated energy consumption of 32 kW-hrs/100 mi in city and 33 kW-hrs/100 mi on the highway, equivalent to 105 mpg city and 102 mpg highway.  The EPA rating for on board energy efficiency for electric vehicles before 2010 was expressed as kilowatt-hour per 100 miles (kW-hrs/100 mi). \nSince November 2010, with the introduction of the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, EPA began using a new metric, miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe). The Roadster was never officially rated by the EPA in MPGe.   In August 2007, Tesla dynamometer testing of a validation prototype on the EPA combined cycle yielded a range of using 149 W·h/km (23.9 kW·h/100 mi) battery-to-wheel and 209 Wh/km (33.6 kW·h/100 mi) plug-to-wheel.   In February 2008, Tesla reported improved plug-to-wheel efficiency after testing a validation prototype car at an EPA-certified location.  Those tests yielded a range of and a plug-to-wheel efficiency of 199 Wh/km (32.1 kW·h /100 mi).   In August 2008, Tesla reported on testing with the new, single-speed gearbox and upgraded electronics of powertrain 1.5 which yielded an EPA range of and an EPA combined cycle, plug-to-wheel efficiency of 174 W·h/km (28 kW·h/100 mi).   In 2007, the Roadster's battery-to-wheel motor efficiency was reported as 88% to 90% on average and 80% at peak power. \nFor comparison, internal combustion engines have a tank-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%. Taking a more complete picture including the cost of energy drawn from its source, Tesla reports that their technology, assuming electricity generated from natural gas-burning power plants, has a high well-to-wheel efficiency of 1.14 km per megajoule, compared to 0.202 km/MJ for gasoline-powered sports cars, 0.478 km/MJ for gasoline-powered commuter cars, 0.556 km/MJ for hybrid cars, and 0.348 km/MJ for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.   Section::::Energy efficiency.:Petroleum-equivalent efficiency. \n As the Roadster does not use gasoline, petroleum efficiency (MPG, L/100 km) cannot be measured directly but instead is calculated using one of several equivalent methods:  A number comparable to the typical Monroney sticker's \"pump-to-wheel\" fuel efficiency can be calculated based on regulations from the DOE and its energy content for a U.S. gallon of gasoline of 33,705  (also called the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of gasoline):  For CAFE regulatory purposes, the DOE's full petroleum-equivalency equation combines the primary energy efficiencies of the USA electric grid and the well-to-pump path with a \"fuel content factor\" that quantifies the value of conservation, scarcity of fuels, and energy security in the USA. This combination yields a factor of 82,049  in the above equation and a regulatory fuel efficiency of 293 mpg.   Recharging with electricity from the average US grid, the factor changes to 12,307  to remove the \"fuel content factor\" =  and the above equation yields a full-cycle energy-equivalency of 44.0 mpg. \nFor full-cycle comparisons, the sticker or \"pump-to-wheel\" value from a gasoline-fueled vehicle must be multiplied by the fuel's \"well-to-pump\" efficiency; the DOE regulation specifies a \"well-to-pump\" efficiency of 83% for gasoline. The Prius's sticker , for example, converts to a full-cycle energy-equivalent of 38.2 mpg.   Recharging with electricity generated by newer, 58% efficiency CCGT power plants, changes the factor to 21,763  in the above equation and yields a fuel efficiency of 77.7 mpg.   Recharging with non-fossil fuel electricity sources such as hydroelectric, solar power, wind or nuclear, the petroleum equivalent efficiency can be even higher as fossil fuel is not directly used in refueling.   Section::::Service.   Whereas vehicles with internal combustion engines require more frequent service for oil changes and routine maintenance on engine components and other related systems, Tesla's website recommends the owner bring the vehicle in for service \"once a year or every 12,000 miles\".  For other concerns with vehicles, Tesla created a \"mobile service unit\" that dispatches company-trained technicians to customers' homes or offices in case the owner is experiencing problems. \nTesla charges the customer according to the distance the service unit needs to travel: one US dollar per mile roundtrip with a 100-dollar minimum. Technicians drive company vans equipped with numerous tools and testing equipment to do \"in the field\" repairs, enhancements and software upgrades.  Tesla debuted this \"house call\" approach in the spring of 2009, when the company announced a recall due to a manufacturing problem in the Lotus assembly plant, which also affected the Lotus Elise and other models from the British sports car maker.   The first Tesla service center, in Los Angeles, California, was opened on Santa Monica Boulevard on May 1, 2008.  Tesla publicly opened their second showroom and service area in Menlo Park, California on July 22, 2008.  The Menlo Park location is also the final assembly area for Tesla Roadsters.  Tesla also operates service centers in New York City, Miami, Chicago, and Seattle.   In 2007, Tesla announced plans to build additional service centers over the following few years to support sales of its next vehicle, the Model S sports sedan.  This included an additional 15 service centers in United States major metropolitan locations.  Possible locations for sales and service locations in Europe were announced in a letter to customers in May 2008.   Section::::Service.:Recalls. \n , Tesla has issued two product safety recalls for the Roadster.  In May 2009, Tesla issued a recall for 345 Roadsters manufactured before April 22, 2009.  Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes to tighten the rear, inner hub flange bolts.  Using wording from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car.  The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line, where the Roadster glider was built.  Lotus also recalled some Elise and Exige vehicles for the same reason.   On October 1, 2010, Tesla issued a second product safety recall in the US affecting 439 Roadsters.  The recall involved the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable from a redundant back-up system.  The recall followed an incident where the low voltage auxiliary cable in a vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel, causing a short, smoke and a possible fire behind the right front headlamp.  This issue was limited to the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable and did not involve the main battery pack or main power system.   Section::::Reviews. \n Tesla Roadster reviews can be grouped in two main categories: older reviews of \"validation prototypes\" (2006–2008), before Tesla began serial production and customer deliveries, and reviews on cars in serial production (2008–2010).  The global online auto review site Autoguide.com tested Tesla's fourth-generation car in October 2010.  Autoguide editor Derek Kreindler said \"The Tesla Roadster 2.5 S is a massively impressive vehicle, more spacecraft than sports car.  Theories like global warming, peak oil and rising oil prices should no longer bring heart palpitations to car fans.  The Tesla shows just how good zero-emissions \"green\" technology can be.  Quite frankly, getting into a normal car at the end of the test drive was a major letdown.  The whirr of the engine, the shove in the backside and the little roadster that seems to pivot around you is replaced by a grunting, belching, feedback-free driving experience\".  He continues on that \"but for a $100,000 car, it could use some work\" complaining of purposefully cheap work.   In the March 2010 print edition of British enthusiast magazine \"EVO\" (p. 120), editor Richard Meaden was the first to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. \nHe said the car had \"serious, instantaneous muscle\". \"With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien.  Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, simply because while they have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or fiddle with launch controls and invalid warranties, all you have to do is floor the throttle and wave goodbye\".   In December 2009, \"The Wall Street Journal\" editor Joseph White conducted an extended test-drive and determined that \"you can have enormous fun within the legal speed limit as you whoosh around unsuspecting Camry drivers, zapping from 40 to 60 miles per hour in two seconds while the startled victims eat your electric dust\".  White praised the car's environmental efficiency but said consumer demand reflected not the environmental attributes of the car but its performance.  \"The Tesla turns the frugal environmentalist aesthetic on its head.  Sure, it doesn't burn petroleum, and if plugged into a wind turbine or a nuclear plant, it would be a very low-carbon machine.  But anyone who buys one will get the most satisfaction from smoking someone's doors off. \nThe Tesla's message is that \"green\" technology can appeal to the id, not just the superego\".  In December 2009, \"Motor Trend\" was the first to independently confirm the Roadster Sport's reported time of 3.7 seconds.  (\"Motor Trend\" recorded of 3.70 seconds; it recorded a quarter-mile test at 12.6 sec at ).  Engineering editor Kim Reynolds called the acceleration \"breathtaking\" and said the car confirms \"Tesla as an actual car company.  ...Tesla is the first maker to crack the EV legitimacy barrier in a century\".   In November 2009, \"Automobile Magazine West Coast\" editor Jason Cammisa spent a week driving a production Tesla Roadster.  Cammisa was immediately impressed with the acceleration, saying the car \"explodes off the line, pulling like a small jet plane. ...  It's like driving a Lamborghini with a big V-12 revved over 6000 rpm at all times, waiting to pounce—without the noise, vibration, or misdemeanor arrest for disturbing the peace\".  He also took the car to Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, and praised the car for its robustness, saying the Roadster:  \"wins the Coolest Car I've Ever Driven award.  Why? \nDespite the flat-out sprints, the drag racing, the donuts, the top-speed runs, and dicing through traffic like there's a jet pack strapped to the trunk, Pacific Gas and Electric—which generated power for the Tesla—released into the atmosphere the same amount of carbon dioxide as would a gasoline-powered car getting 99 mpg. And the Roadster didn't break.  It didn't smoke, lock up, freeze, or experience flux-capacitor failure.  Over the past ten decades, no company has been able to reinvent the car—not General Motors with the EV1, not Toyota with the Prius.  And now, a bunch of dudes from Silicon Valley have created an electric car that really works—as both an environmental fix and a speed fix\".   In 2009 the Tesla Roadster was one of the Scandinavian Sports Car of the Year participants.  In a comparison made by Nordic car magazines \"Tekniikan Maailma\" (Finland), \"Teknikens Värld\" (Sweden) and \"Bil Magasine\"t (Denmark), critics praised the torque of the car and a track car structure, but also highlighted more negative aspects such as a short battery life; they were unable to drive a full track lap in dry track conditions. \n In May 2009, \"Car and Driver\" technical editor Aaron Robinson wrote a review based on the first extended test-drive of a production Tesla Roadster. Robinson had the car for nearly a week at his home.  He complained of \"design anomalies, daily annoyances, absurd ergonomics, and ridiculous economics \" and stated he never got to see if the car could go 240 miles on a single charge because the torturous seating forced him to stop driving the car.  He also complained of Tesla increasing the car prices on those who had already made deposits and charging extra for previously free necessary components.   In February 2009, automotive critic Dan Neil of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the production Tesla Roadster \"a superb piece of machinery: stiff, well sorted, highly focused, dead-sexy and eerily quick\".  Neil said he had the car for 24 hours but \"caned it like the Taliban caned Gillette salesmen and it never even blinked\".   In February 2009, \"Road and Track\" tested another production vehicle and conducted the first independently verified metered testing of the Roadster.  Engineering editor Dennis Simanitis said the testing confirmed what he called \"extravagant claims\", that the Roadster had a 4.0 s acceleration and a range. \nThey said the Roadster felt like \"an over-ballasted Lotus Elise\", but the weight was well-distributed, so the car remained responsive. \"Fit and finish of our Tesla were exemplary\", which \"Road and Track\" thought fit the target market.  Overall, they considered it a \"delight\" to drive.  Testing a pre-production car in early 2008, \"Road and Track\" said \"The Tesla feels composed and competent at speed with great turn-in and transitioning response\", though they recommended against it as a \"primary grocery-getter\".   In January 2009, automotive critic Warren Brown of \"The Washington Post\" called the production Roadster \"a head-turner, jaw-dropper.  It is sexy as all get-out\".  He described the feeling behind the wheel as, \"Wheeeeeee!  Drive a Tesla, even if you have to fly to Tesla's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, to get your hands on one for a day. ...  If this is the future of the automobile, I want it\". \n In a review of a Roadster prototype before the cars were in serial production, \"Motor Trend\" gave a generally favorable review in March 2008, stating that, it was \"undeniably, unbelievably efficient\" and would be \"profoundly humbling to just about any rumbling Ferrari or Porsche that makes the mistake of pulling up next to a silent, Tesla Roadster at a stoplight\"; however, they detected a \"nasty drive-train buck\" during the test drive of an early Roadster with the older, two-speed transmission.  In a July 8, 2007, review of a prototype Roadster, Jay Leno wrote, \"If you like sports cars and you want to be green, this is the only way to go.  The Tesla is a car that you can live with, drive and enjoy as a sports car.  I had a brief drive in the car and it was quite impressive.  This is an electric car that is fun to drive\".   In a November 27, 2006, review of a prototype Roadster in \"Slate\", Paul Boutin wrote, \"A week ago, I went for a spin in the fastest, most fun car I've ever ridden in—and that includes the Aston Martin I tried to buy once. \nI was so excited, in fact, that I decided to take a few days to calm down before writing about it. Well, my waiting period is over, I'm thinking rationally, and I'm still unbelievably stoked about the Tesla\".   Section::::Reviews.:\"Top Gear\" controversy.   In the third quarter of 2008, \"Top Gear\"'s Jeremy Clarkson reviewed two production Roadsters with the v1.5 transmission and described the driving experience with the exclamations \"God Almighty!  Wave goodbye to the world of dial-up, and say hello to the world of broadband motoring!\"  and \"This car is biblically quick!\"  when comparing the acceleration versus the car the Roadster was based on, a Lotus Elise.  Clarkson also noted, however, that the handling of the car was not as sharp as that of the Elise: \"through the corners things are less rosy\".   The Stig recorded a time of 1:27.2 on a moist track, faster than a Nissan 370Z on a dry track but slower than a Porsche 911 C2S also on a damp track, and also slower than the Lotus Exige, Exige S and Evora.   The segment also claimed that the car's batteries would run flat after of heavy use on a track and showed the car being pushed off the track. \n Tesla spokesperson responded with statements in blogs and to mainstream news organizations that the cars provided to \"Top Gear\" never had less than 20% charge and never experienced brake failure.  In addition, neither car provided to \"Top Gear\" needed to be pushed off the track at any point.   Clarkson also showed a wind turbine with stationary rotor blades and complained that it would take countless hours to refuel the car using such a source of electricity, although the car can be charged from a 240 V 70 A outlet in as little as 3.5 hours.   After numerous blogs and several large news organizations began following the controversy, the BBC issued a statement saying \"the tested Tesla was filmed being pushed into the shed in order to show what would happen if the Roadster had run out of charge.  \"Top Gear\" stands by the findings in this film and is content that it offers a fair representation of the Tesla's performance on the day it was tested\", without addressing the other alleged misrepresentations that Tesla highlighted to the media.   After several weeks of increasing pressure and inquiries from the BBC, Clarkson wrote a blog entry for \"The Times\", acknowledging that \"Inevitably, the film we had shot was a bit of a mess. \nThere was a handful of shots of a silver car. Some of a grey car\".  \"But as a device for moving you and your things around, it is about as much use as a bag of muddy spinach\".  In the months that followed Clarkson's acknowledgment, the original episode—including the misstatements—reran on BBC America and elsewhere without any editing, though the BBC is still looking into \"Top Gear\"s journalism standards, according to British media reports.   On March 29, 2011, Tesla sued the programme over libel and malicious falsehood, while simultaneously launching the website TeslaVsTopGear.com.  The current position of Tesla is found on its web page.   In a blogpost, producer Andy Wilman has referred to Tesla's allegations as a \"crusade\" and argued the truth value of Tesla's statements.   On October 19, 2011, the High Court in London rejected Tesla's libel claim.   Tesla appealed High Court's decision to the Court of Appeal, where a three-judge panel of Lords Justice upheld the lower court's decision, and ordered Tesla to pay the BBC's legal costs of £100,000.   Section::::Sales.   Tesla delivered approximately 2,450 Roadsters worldwide between February 2008 and December 2012. \nFeaturing new options and enhanced features, the 2012 Tesla Roadster was sold in limited numbers only in mainland Europe, Asia and Australia, and as of July 2012, less than 140 units were available for sale in Europe and Asia before the remaining inventory would be sold out. Tesla's US exemption for not having special two-stage passenger airbags expired for cars made after the end of 2011 so the last Roadsters were not sold in the American market for regulatory reasons.  The U.S. was the leading market with about 1,800 Roadsters sold.  There were fewer than 50 right-hand-drive models of the Tesla Roadster produced and hand built in the UK.   Section::::Sales.:United States.   The Roadster had a three-year, warranty.  Tesla also offered an extended powertrain warranty and a battery replacement warranty.   In July 2009, Tesla announced that US consumers could finance the Roadster through Bank of America.  Financing was available for up to 75% of the total vehicle purchase price.   Tesla sold Roadsters directly to customers.  It sold them online, in 13 showrooms and over the phone in North America and Europe.  Tesla does not operate through franchise dealerships but operates company-owned stores.  The company said that it took its retail cues from Apple, Starbucks and other non-automotive retailers. \n Section::::Sales.:Outside the United States.  The company has been shipping cars to European customers since mid-2009.  Tesla sold out of its EU special-edition vehicle, which had a 2010 model-year production run of 250 cars.  A total of 575 units have been sold in Europe through October 2012.   Tesla first overseas showroom opened in London in 2009, with right-hand-drive models promised for early 2010.  Showrooms in Munich and Monaco were also added in 2009, followed by Zurich and Copenhagen in 2010 and Milan in 2011.  Reservations for the 2010 Roadster were available for a €3,000 refundable reservation fee.   From 2009 to 2014, Hansjoerg von Gemmingen of Karlsruhe, Germany drove his Tesla Roadster , this being the mileage world record for an all-electric vehicle and reached in 2017.  He also drove another in an Tesla Model S and voiced his plan to become the first man to travel a million kilometres in an electric vehicle.   Kevin Yu, the director of Tesla Motors Asia Pacific, said Roadsters in Japan had additional yearly taxes for exceeding the width limit of normal sized cars.   Section::::Sales.:Controversy. \n In 2009, Roadster reservation holders who had already placed deposits up to US$50,000 to lock in their orders were informed that their orders had been unlocked and that they had to re-option their ordered vehicles on the threat of losing their spot on the orders list. Tesla then raised the prices of several options, and a new Tesla Roadster with the same set of features that had previously been standard became US$6,700 more expensive than before.  For example, the high performance charger that was previously claimed to be standard on all vehicles was changed to be an optional feature costing US$3,000, and the previously claimed standard forged alloy wheels became a US$2,300 upgrade.  One person who pre-ordered a Tesla Roadster complained:  Section::::Awards.

CrossFit is promoted as both a physical exercise philosophy and a competitive fitness sport, incorporating elements from high-intensity interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics, girevoy sport, calisthenics, strongman, and other exercises.  It is practiced by members of over 13,000 affiliated gyms, roughly half of which are located in the United States, and by individuals who complete daily workouts (otherwise known as \"WODs\" or \"workouts of the day\").  CrossFit has been criticized for allegedly causing people to suffer from unnecessary injuries and exertional rhabdomyolysis, a possible life-threatening breakdown of muscle from extreme exertion.   Section::::History.   Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai founded CrossFit, Inc. in 2000.  The company was conceived a few years earlier, in 1996, as \"Cross-Fit\".   The original CrossFit gym is in Santa Cruz, California, and the first affiliated gym was CrossFit North in Seattle, Washington; there were 13 by 2005, and today there are more than 13,000.  Coaches associated with CrossFit include Louie Simmons, John Welbourn, Bob Harper, and Mike Burgener. \n Glassman obtained complete control over the company after a divorce with Jenai. Jenai tried to sell her share in the company to an outside party after the divorce settlement, but Glassman bought it with a $16 million loan from Summit Partners.   Section::::Overview.   CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program consisting mainly of a mix of aerobic exercise, calisthenics (body weight exercises), and Olympic weightlifting.  CrossFit, Inc. describes its strength and conditioning program as \"constantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity across broad time and modal domains,\" with the stated goal of improving fitness, which it defines as \"work capacity across broad time and modal domains.\"  Hour-long classes at affiliated gyms, or \"boxes\", typically include a warm-up, a skill development segment, the high-intensity \"workout of the day\" (or WOD), and a period of individual or group stretching.  Some gyms also often have a strength-focused movement prior to the WOD.  Performance on each WOD is often scored and/or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual progress.  Some affiliates offer additional classes, such as Olympic weightlifting, which are not centered around a WOD. \n CrossFit gyms use equipment from multiple disciplines, including barbells, dumbbells, gymnastics rings, pull-up bars, jump ropes, kettlebells, medicine balls, plyo boxes, resistance bands, rowing machines, and various mats. CrossFit is focused on \"constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement,\" drawing on categories and exercises such as calisthenics, Olympic-style weightlifting, powerlifting, Strongman-type events, plyometrics, body weight exercises, indoor rowing, aerobic exercise, running, and swimming.    CrossFit programming is decentralized, but its general methodology is used by thousands of private affiliated gyms, fire departments, law-enforcement agencies, and military organizations, including the Royal Danish Life Guards, as well as by some U.S. and Canadian high-school physical-education teachers, high-school and college sports teams, and the Miami Marlins.   \"CrossFit is not a specialized fitness program, but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of 10 recognized fitness domains,\" says founder Greg Glassman in the Foundations document.  Those domains are cardiovascular and respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.   A 2014 statistical analysis showed that 50% of CrossFit participants were male and 50% were female. \nCrossFit's growing interest internationally has created a spike in Olympic weightlifting interest in the United States.  Section::::Business model.   CrossFit, Inc. licenses the CrossFit name to gyms for an annual fee and certifies trainers.  Besides the standard two-day \"Level 1 Trainer Course\", specialty seminars include gymnastics, Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, running and endurance, rowing, kettlebells, mobility and recovery, CrossFit Kids, CrossFit Football, and self-defense and striking.  Other specialized adaptations include programs for pregnant women, seniors, and military special operations candidates.  Affiliates develop their own programming, pricing, and instructional methods.  Many athletes and trainers see themselves as part of a contrarian, insurgent movement that questions conventional fitness wisdom.  In addition to performing prescribed workouts, they follow CrossFit's nutrition recommendations, adopting a paleo and/or zone diet.   CrossFit makes use of a virtual community Internet model.  The company says this de-centralized approach shares some common features with open source software projects and allows best practices to emerge from a variety of approaches, a contention that is disputed by some competitors and former affiliates.   Section::::CrossFit Games.   The \"CrossFit Games\", directed by Dave Castro, have been held every summer since 2007. \nAthletes at the Games compete in workouts they learn about only hours beforehand, sometimes including surprise elements that are not part of the typical CrossFit regimen. Past examples include a rough-water swim, a softball throw, and a pegboard climb.  The Games are styled as a venue for determining the \"Fittest on Earth,\" where competitors should be \"ready for anything.\"   In 2011, the Games adopted an online qualification format, facilitating participation by athletes worldwide.  During the five-week-long \"CrossFit Open\", one new workout is released each week.  Athletes have several days to complete the workout and submit their scores online, with either a video or validation by a CrossFit affiliate.  Since the Open is available to any level of athlete, many affiliates encourage member participation and the number of worldwide participants can be in the hundreds of thousands.   The top CrossFit Open performers for individuals and teams in each region advance to the regional events, held over the following two months around the world.  Each regional event qualifies a specified number of its top finishers to send to the Games.  The Games include divisions for individuals of each gender, co-ed teams, and a number of Masters and Teenage age groups.   Section::::Certifications. \n In order to become a certified CrossFit coach, one must go through a series of four training levels. To open a CrossFit affiliated gym, it only requires a coach to be certified to level one.   Level One (CF-L1) is the introduction level, where participants attend a group weekend class, talk about the basic methodology and fundamentals of CrossFit, and learn how to conduct their own classes.  They go over techniques and how to adjust them for those who cannot perform them.  After completing the Level One training course, one should be confident in conducting a class, scale workouts accordingly for athletes, and hold CrossFit to its standards.  In the second level, training goes deeper into the mechanics of the movements and how to be leaders and communicate with other students.  In the Level Two course, participants learn about athletic capacity and are evaluated as a trainer in groups.  In order to earn the Level Three certificate, a coach one must complete 1,500 hours of active fitness coaching and become CPR certified.  To earn the Level Four certificate, the highest level currently recognized by CrossFit, Inc., the coach must record several years as a Level Three and pass a test.   Section::::Criticism. \n Section::::Criticism.:Injury.  The risk of injury associated with CrossFit training has been a controversial question since the program's popularity began to climb in the early 2000s. Critics have accused CrossFit, Inc. of using dangerous movements and inappropriate levels of intensity, and allowing underqualified individuals to become CrossFit Trainers.   In response to these criticisms, CrossFit, Inc. claims, “CrossFit is relatively safe even when performed with poor technique, but it is safer and more effective when performed with good technique.”  CrossFit, Inc. also claims risk for injury can be reduced by properly scaling and modifying workouts, a concept taught on its website and at the CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Course.   CrossFit, Inc. supports this position by citing three academic surveys of CrossFit participants.  These surveys calculated injury rates between 2.4 and 3.1 injuries per 1000 hours of training, which CrossFit argues is consistent with or below injury rates found in \"general fitness training.\"   A study published in the \"Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research\" entitled \"Crossfit-based high intensity power training improves maximal aerobic fitness and body composition\" followed 54 participants for 10 weeks of CrossFit training.  The study said that \"...a notable percentage of our subjects (16%) did not complete the training program and return for follow-up testing.\" \nThe authors said \"This may call into question the risk-benefit ratio for such extreme training programs...\" In 2014, CrossFit, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the National Strength and Conditioning Association for publishing this study, alleging that the data were false and were \"intended to scare participants away from CrossFit.\"  The NSCA denies CrossFit, Inc.'s allegations but has issued an erratum acknowledging that the injury data were incorrect.  In September 2016, the District Court ruled in favor of CrossFit Inc.'s claims that the injury data were found to be false, but not that the NSCA was commercially motivated or that the publishing of the study was defamatory as the NSCA no longer stood behind the study.  In February 2017, CrossFit filed for sanctions against the NSCA after one of the NSCA's witnesses admitted to falsifying statements during deposition.  In May 2017, the Court issued 17 issues sanctions against the NSCA, writing that the organization did have a commercial motive to falsify the data, had published the false data knowingly to disparage CrossFit, and had misled the public with their erratum.  CrossFit was awarded $74,000 in legal fees and allowed to continue investigating the NSCA. \nIf the neutral-party analysis of the NSCA servers turns up any further misconduct, CrossFit may file an amended complaint for further sanctioning and compensation for lost revenue.  In May 2019, CrossFit, Inc. contacted the \"Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine\" with a demand for the retraction of another paper, published in the journal earlier that month.  The paper states that CrossFit participants “are more likely to be injured and to seek medical treatment compared with participants in traditional weightlifting”, a finding that CrossFit, Inc. claimed to be based on scientific errors and material from retracted or mis-represented studies.   Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis.   The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company.  Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis.   A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision.  CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit.   CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. \nThe company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk. One CrossFit spokesman stated that \"ESPN's report on the 53 deaths in US triathlons from 2007 to 2013 should have put the issue to rest.\"   Since May 2005, CrossFit, Inc. has published several articles about rhabdomyolysis in the company's \"CrossFit Journal\".  Three of the articles are included in the \"CrossFit Manual\" provided to all prospective trainers.   CrossFit, Inc. has also been criticized for having a \"cavalier\" attitude towards rhabdomyolysis by promoting a character known as \"Uncle Rhabdo\" (a cartoon clown dying in a dramatic fashion—hooked up to a dialysis machine, with his kidneys and intestines falling on the floor).  In response to this criticism, Greg Glassman stated \"We introduced (Uncle) Rhabdo because we're honest and believe that full disclosure of risk is the only ethical thing to do.\"   Section::::Criticism.:Social media controversies.   CrossFit, Inc. has been variously criticized and praised for its unorthodox approach to social media. \nThis approach has included publishing articles and tweets about non-fitness topics (including politics, philosophy, and poetry) as well as directly interacting with other social media users and critics of the company's program.  On 4 June 2014, CrossFit uploaded a \"parody video to their Facebook page\" of Jesus, featuring concepts such as the \"Holy Trinity of exercise\".  Yasmine Hafiz wrote in \"The Huffington Post\" that some \"viewers are outraged at the disrespectful use of a Christian symbol\", with one user asking \"on what planet is it comical or encouraged to mock someones belief?\"  In one example, CrossFit, Inc.'s Twitter account posted a doctored illustration of a Coke advertisement, with \"Open Happiness\" replaced by \"Open Diabetes\".  The image was paired with a quote from CrossFit CEO Greg Glassman that read \"Make sure you pour out some for your dead homies.\"  Controversy followed after singer Nick Jonas responded to the tweet, calling CrossFit, Inc.'s comments \"ignorant\".  The company defended its tweet, stating that \"Compelling statistical evidence supports CrossFit, Inc.'s campaign to prevent diabetes by raising awareness about its causes.\"  When ABC News asked Greg Glassman to comment on the exchange, he replied \"Fuck Nick Jonas. \nThis is about the scourge of Type 2 Diabetes and its underlying causes. His sponsor, Coca-Cola, is a significant contributor to the diabetes epidemic both with product and 'marketing' spend.\"   In May 2019, CrossFit shuttered its Facebook and Instagram accounts, which had 3.1 million and 2.8 million followers respectively.  On the company's homepage, the announcement stated that CrossFit was concerned about user privacy and security in the wake of \"well-known public complaints about the social-media company that may adversely impact the security and privacy of our global CrossFit community.\"  The company also cited theft of intellectual property and Facebook's collusion with \"food and beverage industry interests\" as reasons for deactivating its social media accounts.

{"id":"KILT_3885852","text":" Islamic poetry  Islamic poetry is poetry written by Muslims.  Islamic poetry has been written in many languages.   Section::::History and origins.   Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran.  Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”.  This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran.   Islamic poetry is very important and it is heritage passed generation to generation.  These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan.  These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day.  Also, Islamic poetry is found centuries ago.  Islamic poetry is different in many ways like cultural, Traditions, Literature, etc. Hashem stated, \"Islamic religious poetry has been composed in a wide variety of languages\". \n(Deen) poetry is a very important thing in the Islamic religion because poetry has equality of beauty to the Islamic religion. Also, poetry use in many different languages around the world.  Most importantly, poetry, which had once been shunned for representing the ideals of paganism, was brought into the service of Islam.  Islamic art has always retained its intrinsic quality and unique identity.  Just as the religion of Islam embodies a way of life and serves as a cohesive force among ethnically and culturally diverse peoples, the art produced by and for Muslim societies has basic identifying and unifying characteristics.  Hashem stated, \"Islamic art is a modern concept created by art historians in the 19th century to facilitate categorization and study of the material first produced under the Islamic peoples that emerged from Arabia in the seventh century\" ( Deen).   Section::::Islamic poetry in different languages.   BULLET::::- In Arabic poetry, the qasida (ode) is considered by scholars to be one of its most distinguishing aspects.  originating around 500 bc, it is also considered to be fundamental to the development of pre-Islamic poetry.  It is composed in monorhyme having between fifteen and eighty lines. \nThe qasida contains three subtopics or recurring themes; the nasib or the story of a destroyed relationship and home, the fakhr which portrays self-praise for a tribe or oneself, and the rahil which is a journey into the desert involving camels. The qasida also involves biographical anecdotes called akhbar, which shows stories of revenge-taking and blood-sacrifice necessary to go through a rite of passage.  The major components of the akhbar are the recurring themes of blood-revenge, initiated by the death of a father or loved one, and the \"arrested development\" of a person during their youth.   poem  Effaced are the abodes,  At Mina the wilderness has claimed  The torrent channels of Mount Rayyan,  Preserved as surely as inscriptions are  Dung-darkened patches over which,  Their profane mouths and sacred ones  They were watered by the rain  And on them fell the rain of thunderclouds,  /poem  BULLET::::- Bengali poetry depicts the themes of internal conflict and existential ideas concerning one’s relationship with the tribe.  This search for meaning that is present in most Bengali poems leads to the frustration depicted by poets through their dark and melancholy tones.  Frustration is not pessimism, which according to scholars, some readers can misinterpret from the negative tones throughout Bengali poetry. \nThe recurring theme of ideological values rather than societal ones is also present. Modern Bengali poetry is considered to be not rhetorical and romantic in composition.   BULLET::::- Persian poetry originates in the modern-day countries of Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, and Pakistan, along with some areas in India during the tenth century.  Genres present in classical Persian poetry vary and are determined by rhyme, which consists of a vowel followed by a single-rhyming letter.  The most common form of Persian poetry comes in the ghazal, a love-themed short poem made of seven to twelve verses and composed in the monorhyme scheme.   BULLET::::- In Punjabi poetry, the central theme is the internal conflict caused by worldly problems, along with existential ideas presented by the poet.  Another theme present throughout Punjabi poetry is the paradoxical idea of life and how although wealth and knowledge is presented to a person, it is that wealth and knowledge that can distance them from the real meaning and truth of life.   BULLET::::- Turkish poetry  BULLET::::- Urdu poetry  BULLET::::- In English, Islamic poetry now tends to be free-form (unrhymed).

{"id":"KILT_14083964","text":" Animal psychopathology  Animal psychopathology is the study of mental or behavioral disorders in animals.   Historically, there has been an anthropocentric tendency to emphasize the study of animal psychopathologies as models for human mental illnesses.  But animal psychopathologies can, from an evolutionary point of view, be more properly regarded as non-adaptive behaviors due to some sort of a cognitive disability, emotional impairment or distress.  This article provides a non-exhaustive list of animal psychopathologies.   Section::::Eating disorders.   Animals in the wild appear to be relatively free from eating disorders although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and reproductive cycles.  However, domesticated animals including farm, laboratory, and pet animals are prone to disorders.  Evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior in wild animals.  The expectation is that farm animals also display this behavior, but questions arise if the same principles apply to laboratory and pet animals.   Section::::Eating disorders.:Activity anorexia.   Activity anorexia (AA) is a condition where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia.  When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. \nHowever, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so that most of the running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled.  In other conditions, AA does not develop.  Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine.  Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly.  In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior.  Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain.  One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats.  Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages.  The effect of semi-starvation on activity has also been studied in primates.  Rhesus macaque males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic food restriction.   Section::::Eating disorders.:Thin sow syndrome. \n Thin Sow Syndrome (TSS) is a behavior observed in stalled sows that is similar to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little, and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from emaciation, hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness, and hyperactivity.  The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors.  Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units.  The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors.  However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning.  When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously.  It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow.  Affected sows have poor appetite but often show pica, excessive water intake (polydipsia) and are anemic. \n Studies on the effects of overcrowding were conducted in the 1940s by placing pregnant Norway rats in a room with plenty of water and food and observing the population growth. The population reached a number of individuals and did not grow thereafter; overcrowding produced stress and psychopathologies.  Even though there was plenty of water and food, the rats stopped eating and reproducing.   Similar effects have also been observed in dense populations of beetles.  When overcrowding occurs, female beetles destroy their eggs and turn cannibalistic, eating each other.  Male beetles lose interest in the females and although there is plenty of water and food, there is no population growth.  Similar effects have been observed in overcrowded situations in jack rabbits and deer.   Section::::Eating disorders.:Pica.   Pica is the ingestion of non-nutritive substances and has so far been poorly documented.  In non-human animals in the laboratory it has been examined through the ingestion of kaolin (a clay mineral) by rats.  Rats were induced to intake kaolin by administering various emetic stimuli such as copper sulfate, apomorphine, cisplatin, and motion.  Rats are unable to vomit when they ingest a substance that is harmful thus pica in rats is analogous to vomiting in other species; it is a way for rats to relieve digestive distress. \nIn some animals pica seems to be an adaptive trait but in others it seems to be a true psychopathology like in the case of some chickens. Chickens can display a type of pica when they are feed-deprived (feeding restriction has been adopted by the egg industry to induce molting).  They increase their non-nutritive pecking, such as pecking structural features of their environment like wood or wire on fences or the feathers of other birds.  It is a typical response that occurs when feeding is restricted or is completely withdrawn.  Some of the non-nutritive pecking may be due to a redirection of foraging related behavior.  Another animal that has displayed a more complex pica example are cattle.  Cattle eat bones when they have a phosphorus deficiency.  However, in some cases they persist on eating bones even after their phosphorus levels have stabilized and they are getting adequate doses of phosphorus in their diet.  In this case evidence supports both a physical and psychological adaptive response.  Cattle that continue to eat bones after their phosphorus levels are adequate do it because of a psychological reinforcer.  \"The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.\" \n Cats also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica.  Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances.  This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common.  Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame.  Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to cope with the changes.  Pica is also observed predominately during 6–8 months of a cat's life when territorial and sexual behaviors emerge.  Pica may be induced by these social stressors. \nOther theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of prey-catching/ingestion behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to risk of theft. In natural environments pica has been observed in parrots (such as macaws) and other birds and mammals.  Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the Amazon to detoxify the seeds they eat.  Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay.  Munn has found that clay helps counter the tannin and alkaloid in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the Andes Mountains in Peru.   Pica also affects domesticated animals.  While drugs like Prozac are often able to diminish troublesome behaviors in pet dogs, they don't seem to help with this eating disorder.  The following story about Bumbley, a wire fox terrier who appeared on \"20/20\" as a result of his eating disorder, is taken from a book by Dr. Nicholas Dodman.   Dodman talks about new research relating bulimia and compulsive overeating to seizural behavior in human patients.  He suggests that anti-epileptic medication might be a possible treatment for some cases of pica in animals.   Section::::Behavioral disorders. \n Behavioral disorders are difficult to study in animal models because it is difficult to know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively communicate that he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed?  Lacking the ability to use language to study behavioral disorders like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted.  It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).   Obsessive compulsive behavior in animals, often called \"stereotypy\" or \"stereotypical behavior\" can be defined as a specific, unnecessary action (or series of actions) repeated more often than would normally be expected.  It is unknown whether animals are able to 'obsess' in the same way as humans, and because the motivation for compulsive acts in non-human animals is unknown, the term \"abnormal repetitive behaviour\" is less misleading.   A wide variety of animals exhibit behaviors that can be considered abnormally repetitive.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).:Ritualized and stereotyped behaviors.   Though obsessive-compulsive behaviors are often considered to be pathological or maladaptive, some ritualized and stereotyped behaviors are beneficial.  These are usually known as fixed action patterns. \nThese behaviors sometimes share characteristics with obsessive-compulsive behavior, including a high degree of similarity in form and use among many individuals and a repetitive dimension.  There are many observable animal behaviors with characteristic, highly conserved patterns.  One example is grooming behavior in rats.  This behavior is defined by a specific sequence of actions that does not normally differ between individual rats.  The rat first begins by stroking its whiskers, then expands the stroking motion to include the eyes and the ears, finally moving on to lick both sides of its body.  Other behaviors may be added to the end of this chain, but these four actions themselves are fixed.  Its ubiquity and high degree of stereotypy suggest that this is a beneficial behavior pattern which has been maintained throughout evolutionary history.   Pathological stereotyped behaviors also exist in animals, but they do not necessarily provide a similar model to OCD in humans.  Feather picking in orange-winged amazon parrots has both a genetic component, with the behavior being more likely in one sibling if the other does it, and more common in parrots close to a door when they were housed in groups. \nThe same study found that feather picking was more common in females and that there was no social transmission of the behavior; neighbors of feather picking birds were only more likely to show the behavior as well if they were related.  Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).:An evolutionary basis.   Some researchers believe that disadvantageous obsessive compulsive behaviors can be thought of as a normally beneficial process gone too far.  Brüne (2006) suggests that change of various origin in striatal and frontal brain circuits, which play a role in predicting needs and threats that may arise in the future, may result in a hyperactive cognitive harm avoidance system, in which a person becomes consciously and unreasonably fearful of an unlikely or impossible event.  This may also be true in other animals.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).:Genetic factors.   Canine compulsions are more common in some breeds and behavioral dispositions are often shared within the same litter.  This suggests that there is a genetic factor to the disorder.  A questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds, miniature and standard bull terriers, German shepherds, and Staffordshire bull terriers showed these to be more susceptible to compulsive and repetitive behaviors. \nIt is suggested that the more we learn through studying OCD in dogs, the more we can to understand human biology and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as OCD.  A chromosome has been located in dogs that confers a high risk of susceptibility to OCD.  Canine chromosome 7 has been found to be most significantly associated with obsessive compulsive disorder in dogs, or more specifically, canine compulsive disorder (CCD).  This breakthrough helped further relate OCD in humans to CCD in canines.  Canine chromosome 7 is expressed in the hippocampus of the brain, the same area that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is expressed in human patients.  Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways.  This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).:Animal models.   Animals exhibiting obsessive and compulsive behaviors that resemble OCD in humans have been used as a tool for elucidating possible genetic influences on the disease, potential treatments, and to better understand the pathology of this behavior in general. \nWhile such models are useful, they are also limited; it is unclear whether the behavior is ego dystonic in animals. That is, it is difficult to evaluate whether an animal is aware that its behavior is excessive and unreasonable and whether this awareness is a source of anxiety.   One study done by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to investigate serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) to measure the serotonin 2A receptor availability.  When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD were found to have lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability.  The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs.  Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.   Some treatment has been given to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment.  A combination of the two approaches has been found to be most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. \nPharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study.  Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.   Alicia Graef's article makes several bold claims that dogs are the future in understanding how to better diagnose, recognize, and treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans.  There is evidence supporting her statements, but the connection between CCD and OCD is not clearly understood.  So far, studies have proved that effective treatments in dogs are similarly effective for humans, but there are still so many things unknown.  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a unique mental disorder that cannot be fully cured.  It can be controlled and understood, and one possible way of better doing that might be through studying CCD in canines. \nStudying dogs that exhibit compulsive behaviors has led scientists to genetic breakthroughs in understanding more how biology and genetics factor into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. By observing and studying how CCD manifests in the brain activity, behaviors, and genes of diagnosed canines, scientists have been able to use their newfound information to develop better diagnostic tests and more readily recognize symptoms and susceptible humans.  The similar brain functions and behaviors of dogs with CCD and humans with OCD suggests they have a connection, not only in behavior and symptoms, but in reacting to treatments.  Understanding Canine Compulsive Disorder in dogs has helped scientists to better understand and apply their learning to developing new and more effective ways to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans.   Some examples of ways in which rats and mice, two of the most common animal models, have been used to represent human OCD are provided below.   Lever pressing in rats  Certain laboratory rat strains that have been created by controlled breeding for many generations show a higher tendency towards compulsive behaviors than other strains.  Lewis rats show more compulsive lever pressing behavior than Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats and are less responsive to the anti-compulsive drug paroxetine.  In this study, rats were taught to press a lever to receive food in an operant conditioning task. \nOnce food was no longer provided when they pressed the lever, rats were expected to stop pressing it. Lewis rats pressed the lever more often than the other two types, even though they had presumably learned that they would not receive food, and continued to press it more often even after treatment with the drug.  An analysis of the genetic differences between the three rat strains might help to identify genes that might be responsible for the compulsive behavior.   Rats have also been used to test the possibility of a problem with dopamine levels in the brains of animals that exhibit compulsive checking behavior.  After treating rats with quinpirole, a chemical that specifically blocks dopamine D2/D3 receptors, compulsive checking of certain locations in an open field increased.  Some components of the checking behavior, such as the level of stereotypy in the path animals took to checked locations, the number of checks, and the length of the checks indicated an increase in compulsivity as doses of quinpirole increased; other components, such as the time taken to return from the checked location to the starting point and the time taken to make that trip remained constant after the initial injection throughout the experiment.  This means that there might be both an all-or-none and a sensitization aspect in the biology of the dopamine deficiency model of OCD. \nIn addition, quinpirole might reduce a sense of satisfaction in the rats after they check a location, causing them to return to that location again and again.  Estrogen deficiency in male mice  Based on findings of changes in OCD symptoms in menstruating women and differences in the development of the disease between men and women, Hill and colleagues set out to research the effect of estrogen deprivation on the development of compulsive behavior in mice.  Male mice with an aromatase Gene knockout who were unable to produce estrogen showed excessive grooming and wheel running behaviors, but female mice did not.  When treated with 17β-estradiol, which replaced estrogen in these mice, the behaviors disappeared.  This study also found that COMT protein levels decreased in mice that did not produce estrogen and increased in the hypothalamus after estrogen-replacement treatment.  Briefly, the COMT protein is involved in degrading some neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.  This data suggests that there may be a hormonal component and a hormone-gene interaction effect that may contribute to obsessive behaviors.   Pets  Dr. Nicholas Dodman describes a wide variety of OCD-like behaviors in his book Dogs Behaving Badly. \nSuch behaviors typically appear when the dog is placed in a stressful situation, including an environment that is not very stimulating, or in dogs with a history of abuse. Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions.  Lick granuloma, or licking repeatedly until ulcers form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like Labradors, golden retrievers, Great Danes, and Dobermans, while bull terriers, German shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Rottweilers, wire-haired fox terriers, and springer spaniels are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows.  These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect of the behaviors.   Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman noticed that dogs often demonstrate obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans.  Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) is not only specific to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions.  For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors.  Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. \nMost commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, as if there were a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs.  Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).:Treatment (pharmaceutical).   Dodman advocates the use of exercise, an enriched environment (like providing noises for dogs to listen to while owners are at work), and often Prozac (an SSRI used to treat OCD in humans) as treatments.   Shuster and Dodman tested pharmaceutical treatment on canines with CCD to see if it would work as effectively as it does in humans.  They used glutamate receptor blockers (memantine) and fluoxetine, commonly known as the antidepressant Prozac, to treat and observe the reactions of 11 dogs with compulsions.  Seven of the 11 dogs significantly reduced their compulsions in intensity and frequency after receiving medication.   Dodman includes a story about Hogan, a castrated deaf male Dalmatian, and his compulsive behavior. \nHogan had a history of neglect and abuse before he was adopted by Connie and Jim, who attempted to improve his behavior by teaching him to respond to American Sign Language. The following are some excerpts from Hogan's file.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Addiction.   Sugar addiction has been examined in laboratory rats and it develops in the same way that drug addiction develops.  Eating sugary foods causes the brain to release natural chemicals called opioids and dopamine in the limbic system.  Tasty food can activate opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area and thereby stimulate cells that release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc).  The brain recognizes the intense pleasure derived from the dopamine and opioids release and learns to crave more sugar.  Dependence is created through these natural rewards, the sugary treats, and the opioid and dopamine released into the synapses of the mesolimbic system.  The hippocampus, the insula and the caudate activate when rats crave sugar, which are the same areas that become active when drug addicts crave the drug.  Sugar is good because it provides energy, but if the nervous system goes through a change and the body becomes dependent on the sugar intake, somatic signs of withdrawal begin to appear like chattering teeth, forepaw tremors and head shakes when sugar is not ingested. \nMorphine tolerance, a measure of addiction, was observed in rats and their tolerance on Morphine was attributed to environmental cues and the systemic effects of the drug. Morphine tolerance does not depend merely on the frequency of pharmacological stimulation, but rather on both the number of pairings of a drug-predictive cue with the systemic effects of the drug.  Rats became significantly more tolerant to morphine when they had been exposed to a paired administration than those rats that were not administered a drug-predictive cue along with the morphine.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Depression.   Using dogs, Martin Seligman and his colleagues pioneered the study of depression in the animal model of learned helplessness at the University of Pennsylvania.  Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being shocked and group B had no control over when they were being electrocuted.  After the shocking condition, the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition.  To eliminate an interference effect – that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal escape behavior – the dogs were immobilized using curare, a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. \nBoth the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts.  Consequently, a theory emerged that attributed the behavior of the animals to the effects of the shock as a stressor so extreme that it depleted a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement.  After the dogs study the effects of helplessness have been tested in species from fish to cats.  Most recently learned helplessness has been studied in rhesus macaques using inescapable shock, evoked through stress situations like forced swimming, behavioral despair tasks, tails suspension and pinch induced catalepsy; situations that render the monkey incapable of controlling the environment.   Depression and low mood were found to be of a communicative nature.  They signal yielding in a hierarchy conflict or a need for help.  Low mood or extreme low mood (also known as depression) can regulate a pattern of engagement and foster disengagement from unattainable goals.  \"Low mood increases an organism's ability to cope with the adaptive challenges characteristic of unpropitious situations in which effort to pursue a major goal will likely result in danger, loss, bodily damage, or wasted effort.\"  Being apathetic can have a fitness advantage for the organism. \nDepression has also been studied as a behavioral strategy used by vertebrates to increase their personal or inclusive fitness in the threat of parasites and pathogens.  The lack of neurogenesis has been linked to depression.  Animals with stress (isolated, cortisol levels) show a decrease in neurogenesis and antidepressants have been discovered to promote neurogenesis.  Rene Hen and his colleagues at Columbia University ran a study on rats in which they blocked neurogenesis by applying radiation to the hippocampal area to test the efficacy of antidepressants.  Results suggested that antidepressants failed to work when neurogenesis was inhibited.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Stress.   Robert Sapolsky has extensively studied baboons in their natural environment in the Serengeti in Africa.  He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans.  They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs, leaving them with time to develop their social network.  In primates, mental stresses show up in the body.  Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that, over time, can make them sick.  Sapolsky observed the baboons' ranks, personalities and social affiliations, then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (stress hormone) levels of the baboons, then matched social position to cortisol levels. \nMost of the data have been collected from male baboons, because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant. Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels: friendships, perspective, and rank.  Baboons had lower levels of cortisol if they 1. played with infants and cultivated friendships, 2. could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell if they were going to win or lose, and 3. were top ranking.   Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels.  Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both.  Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease sex drive, affect sleeping patterns and elevate blood pressure but it can also stimulate and motivate.  When animals experience stress, they are generally more alert than when they are not stressed.  It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments.  Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by an inverted U-shape graph. \nAccording to the Yerkes-Dodson Law, performance increases, as does cognitive arousal, but only to a certain point. The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance, but only to a certain point.  When stress becomes too great, performance and efficiency decline.   Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects.  Rats that were exposed to human handling (a stressful situation) had finely-tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled.  In short: stress can be adaptive.  The more exposure to stressful situations, the better the rat can handle that situation.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Stereotypies.  Stereotypies are repetitive, sometimes abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds.  There are adaptive stereotypic behaviors such as grooming in cats and preening in birds.  Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies.  These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal.  Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. \nFeather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness as studies have shown that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior.  Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation.  Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage.  Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example the presence or absence of certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs).  These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning.  Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.   Stereotypies may be coping mechanisms as results suggest from study on tethered and stalled sows.  Sows that are tethered and stalled exhibited more stereotypies like licking and rubbing than sows that are in groups outdoors.  This abnormal behavior seems to be related to opioid (related to the reward system) receptor density. \nIn sows, prolonged confinement, being tethered or being in gestation crates, results in abnormal behaviors and stereotypies. Mu and Kappa receptors are associated with aversion behaviors and Mu receptor density is greater in tethered sows than sows that are in groups outdoors.  However, sows with stereotypy behaviors experienced a decrease both in Mu and Kappa receptor density in the brain suggesting that inactivity increases Mu receptor density and stereotypy development decrease both kappa and Mu receptor density.   Section::::Behavioral disorders.:Self-aggression.   Rhesus macaques have been observed to display self-aggression (SA) including self-biting, self-clasping, self-slapping, self-rubbing and threatening of body parts.  The rhesus macaques observed were individually caged and free of disease.  Their self-aggression level rose in stressful and stimulating conditions such as moving from one cage to another.  Stump-tailed macaques were studied to examine the source of their SA.  SA increased in an impoverished environment and results support that SA may increase sensory input in poor environments.  Captive macaques do not socialize the way wild macaques do which may affect SA.  When allowed to socialize by putting another macaque in the cage or not putting them in a cage, SA levels in macaques decrease.  Results indicate that SA is a form of redirected social aggression. \nSA is related to frustration and social status, especially in macaques that have an intermediate dominance rank.

{"id":"KILT_38497714","text":" Longleaf pine ecosystem  The longleaf pine ecosystem is a diverse climax temperate coniferous forest habitat that includes many rare plant and animal species found within the southeastern United States, and is one of the most biodiverse in North America.  Once a dominant ecosystem of the southeastern portion of the United States, it now occupies less than a quarter of the original range.  Degrading of the ecosystem is partially due to excessive timber harvesting, urbanization, and fire exclusion.  Although the ecosystem is heavily fragmented in present time, it still carries a great diversity of plant and animal species, many of which are endemic.  The greatest current concern for the ecosystem is the continuation and health of the overall plant and animal species which reside within the area.  The use of a range of techniques, including planting longleaf seedlings, introducing prescribed burning regimens, managing native ground cover, and controlling invasive species within the ecosystem can help to preserve this threatened ecosystem.   Section::::Origins.   The prehistoric assumption of how the longleaf pine ecosystem was shaped comes from investigation of the time period of the ice age of the earth.  Though the ice age period happened thousands of years ago, geologists feel certain about the reasoning of its start.  The main ice cap of the original ice age extended southward to parts of the now present Ohio River of North America. \nFrom this phenomenon of freezing, the south portion of North America was affected with a cooler and drier climate. As a result, vegetation such as the longleaf pine and other pine species were associated with the coastal regions of the unexposed ice cap areas.  These unexposed areas consisted of now present states Florida to Mexico.  In the periods to follow, as the earth’s climate slowly warmed, the ice caps receded northward.  With this slow succession, the climate of the south progressively changed to warm and dry.  Also as a factor of the climate change, evolving of the longleaf pine ecosystem took place.   Although some geologists feel confident about the reasoning of the beginning of the ecosystem, some speculation of this reasoning is challenged by other researchers.  This fact of challenge comes from little to no systematic data based out of the coastal regions of Florida to Mexico.  With this lack of systematic data, no statistical values for reconstruction of the original ecosystem can be calculated.  However extensive literature from various explores of southeastern North America is reliable when it comes to reconstructing original ecosystem information.  Such literature is dated back as far as 1608, when captain John Smith recorded his accounts of the forest and first exports products of pines close to the new settlement in Jamestown, Virginia.   Section::::Discovery. \n The longleaf pine ecosystem was identified in the early 1500s by the Spaniard Hernando de Soto, although accounts of Native Americans have been documented in journals of European explorers as well.  It was later reported that this ecosystem consisted of 70 million acres of pure and 20 million acres of mixed longleaf pine stands; all together the total was 90 million acres.  The range of the ecosystem extended from southeastern Virginia down to northern Florida over to eastern Texas.  Within this range, the ecosystem was found most dominate of the Coastal Plains regions associated with the states.   Section::::Role of fire.   The longleaf pine ecosystem is known as a fire climax community.  The organization group Longleaf Alliance defines a fire climax community as \"a plant and animal community that is limited by and adapted to an early successional stage by frequent fire disturbances\".   The role of fire in the longleaf pine ecosystem was and still is today a key component in regeneration and shaping of the ecosystem.  In pre-European establishment years, Native Americans set fires quite regularly.  By doing so, they benefited their needs of establishing hunting grounds, homesteads, and safe havens.  While achieving their goals, they were enriching the longleaf pine ecosystem by shaping the dynamics of the system.  Wildfire also played a role in the ecosystem. \nThunderstorms moved into the South in the summer months, and lightning strikes ignited fires. Once lit by humans or lightning, fires burned across the landscape for days, weeks, and even months due to the lack of habitat fragmentation by roads, railroads, or cities.   Section::::Animal and plant diversity.   The longleaf pine ecosystem is one of the richest habitats in North America, and its forest floor is one of the most diverse of its kind in the world.  As of 2001, there are an estimated 27 federal endangered species and 100 species of concern that reside in the ecosystem.  Some of the species in this ecosystem have limited range due to topography and climate of some regions of the system.  The most notable species of the ecosystem are the longleaf pine, wiregrass, and red-cockaded woodpecker, all of which were found throughout the historic range.  The longleaf pine (\"Pinus palustris\") is characterized as having bushy clusters of long needles and large long pine cones.  These pines are capable of growing tall with a diameter of across, only in well suited soil.  The longleaf pine is most notable for thick bark, which aids in the resistant to fire and to southern pine beetle outbreaks. \n The grass species Carolina wiregrass (\"Aristida stricta\"), which is found in the northern portion, and southern wiregrass (\"Aristida beyrichiana\"), which is found in the southern portion, are the dominating grass species of the habitat. These grass species occur in clumps which measure across and have flat leaves that reach long.  The wiregrass species play a key role in the reproduction and spread of the longleaf pine, as they help to carry fire across the land.   The red-cockaded woodpecker (\"Picoides borealis\") was once a common inhabitant of this habitat, but since the decline of the ecosystem it has been placed on the federal endangered species list.    The woodpecker adults are characterized by being long, with a black head, white cheek patch, and barred back with black and white stripes that give the appearance of a latter.  In males, a red strip atop the head is only visible when young or up close.  This woodpecker carefully selects longleaf pine, or associated pine species of the area, for heart rot disease.  Once a tree is selected, excavation of a cavity is achieved usually taking 2 years to complete.   Embedded within the longleaf pine ecosystem are countless varieties of microhabitats.  Among the more unique of these habitats are pitcher plant bogs. \nPitcher plants and their companion plants are specialized to exist in a narrow set of conditions. Soil moisture is critical and many \"bog\" communities are actually the result of a hard, impermeable clay layer beneath porous sand.  Rainwater seeps through the sand but runs into a clay layer where it is either trapped (like a pool) or seeps out the side of a hill.  These nutrient-poor, moist sites are ideal for the carnivorous pitcher plants.  Bogs common to many \"flatwood\" longleaf areas are called \"wet prairies\" while other bogs found on hillsides are called \"seepage slopes\".  The transition from forest to an open bog is not immediate.  Forests usually grade into a wetland bog habitat.  This transition area is called an ecotone and hosts a rich variety of plant and animal species.    Pitcher plants have modified leaves shaped into hollow tubes (that look like a water pitcher), which attract insects.  Downward pointing hairs and slippery walls make escape difficult and the insects are dissolved and digested by enzymes in the bottom of the pitcher.  Other plants trap small insects on flat sticky leaves before slowly digesting them.   Several types of pitcher plants as well as other carnivorous plants grow in the longleaf pine ecosystem. \nSpecies include the hooded pitcher plant, trumpet pitcher plant, white-topped pitcher plant, and parrot pitcher plant. Other bog plants include colic-root; goldcrest; meadow-beauty (also called deerflower); white-topped sedge; orange milkwort (also called bog \"Cheetos\" because of their resemblance to that treat); bog-buttons (also called \"hatpins\"); several species of orchids; and many other wildflowers.  Both soil moisture conditions and full sun are critical to these plants.  Most of these bog plants have little shade tolerance.  Pitcher plant bogs are fire dependent habitats.  The frequent fires common to the longleaf ecosystem keep woody shrubs from encroaching on bogs.  Without fire, moisture-loving shrubs invade drying up bogs and shading out the herbaceous plants.    Despite the longleaf pine ecosystem's heavy endangerment and degradation, new species are still being described from it due to its heavy biodiversity.  In 2018, one of the world's largest salamanders, the reticulated siren, was described from wetlands in the longleaf pine ecosystem along the Gulf Coastal Plain.   Section::::Decline.   The decline of the ecosystem was brought forth slowly first, by the decline of Native Americans. \nThe decline of the Native Americans was mostly contributed by the rapid advancement of diseases across southeast portion of North America in the 1500s. Reports of the diseases were accounted by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, during his exploration of the southeastern portion of the state in 1539–1542.  As Native American populations declined the use of fire declined, as well.   However, around the mid 1500s where Native Americans had left off, Europeans slowly starting using fire as a management tool.  The continuation of fire was aided mainly due to the backgrounds of Europeans from England, Scotland, and Ireland, which understood the need of fire to shape the land.  Along with this transition of between Native Americans cultures to European, some exotic animals were introduces into the ecosystem.  One key species of concern towards the ecosystem was the razorback hog (Sus scrofa scrofa).  This species was extensively responsible for damages to plants found in the ecosystem such as longleaf pine seedlings.   As years passed in the 1600s and 1700s, conversions to the landscape and exploiting of the resources in the ecosystem increased.  Small living quarters such as log cabins were established first by using longleaf pine from the ecosystem.  On a year bases, homes became more elaborate and abundant using substantially more longleaf pine. \nWith the boom in home building, word spread of the good characteristics the longleaf pine had for construction purpose, and soon was being exported overseas. Also included in exports overseas was longleaf pine resin or known as naval stores.  To obtain the resin from the live longleaf pine, pioneers first cut and removed wood exposing a deep cavity, called a box at the base of the tree.  Next a medium-sized, V-shaped cut was performed, above the box to start the resin flow into the box.  As resin flowed into the box, it was collected and placed in barrels for shipment.  Although, in years after establishing the resin producing tree, the tree itself would become weak and sensitive to wind storms.   Roads and railroads were constructed in various locations throughout the southeast beginning in the 1800s for the purpose of accommodating the ease of forest harvesting and transportation of goods.  However, with the construction of roads and homes, habitat fragmentation was introduced to the longleaf pine ecosystem.   After the Civil War in 1865, the Agriculture boom started.  Many pioneers had received word about the cash crop Cotton, soon land purchase and the clearing of land increased significantly.  With this sudden shift in land use, the additions of large plantations were established in the ecosystem, as well. \nIn result of this boom plus the addition of forest harvesting and transportation right of ways, further habitat loss was increasing at an alarming rate.  During the early 1900s, more habitat lost was due to World War I. Vast acres of the longleaf pine in the southeast were cleared to aid in ship building for the war effort.  With this push in demand, 1909 marked the peak of longleaf pine lumber production.  At this period, it was realized that decline in the ecosystem was eminent through the bare landscape with little regeneration of longleaf pine.  So to compensate for loss, replanting of some clear-cuts areas in the ecosystem was planted by land owners and Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees during the Great Depression era of the mid 1900s.  Although in some sectors of landowners in the southeast learned over the years that the longleaf pine was a slow growing tree, and thus began replanting the ecosystem with faster growing trees species like the slash and loblolly pine.  With replanting the species slash pine and loblolly pine a faster tree growth / lumber production was achieved.   As of 2011, only 3 million or so acres of the longleaf pine ecosystem are left in North America.  This significant drop in the ecosystem acreage marks a 97 percent decrease. \nIn overlook of the ecosystem, today, it is described as being patchy and uneven in the distribution across the landscape. Of the now 3 percent ecosystem acreage, there is a documented 8,856 acres of old growth longleaf pine stands left.   Section::::Concern of the ecosystem today.   In the past, the first concerns of the longleaf pine ecosystem were brought to attention in the early 1900s.  These concerns were primarily focused on regeneration of harvested longleaf pine stands and remaining pine stands in the ecosystem.  Men like Henry E. Hardtner and Herman H. Chapman were among the first to collaborate ways to implement longleaf regeneration in the ecosystem.  Later the United States Forest Service recognized and had studied the need of fire in the ecosystem burning (man lit fire) was implemented on national forest.   The major concerns of the longleaf pine ecosystem as present (2000s) are urbanization and fire suppression.  With the North American population increasing by roughly 2.5 million people a year, the competition for space is increasing.  Threat to the longleaf pine ecosystem is emanate through land clearing for commercial businesses and housing developments.  Ultimately due to urbanization, fire suppression is caused, because of human endangerment.  With this result of human endangerment, the lack of fire in the ecosystem could result in further deterioration of it. \nIn result, the federal government and state government agencies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia have teamed up to provide aid to this critical ecosystem. This aid comes in the form of cost share programs, set up by states to assist private land owners in education, financial aid, and guidance on the longleaf pine ecosystem restoration.

{"id":"KILT_2091783","text":" Invasive carcinoma of no special type  Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) also known as invasive ductal carcinoma or ductal NOS and previously known as invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) is a group of breast cancers that do not have the \"specific differentiating features\".  Those that have these features belong to other types.   In this group are: pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinoma with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells, carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous features, and carcinoma with melanotic features.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that for the diagnosis to be made all the other specific types must be ruled out.   Section::::Classification.   Invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) is the most common form of invasive breast cancer.  It accounts for 55% of breast cancer incidence upon diagnosis, according to statistics from the United States in 2004.  On a mammogram, it is usually visualized as a mass with fine spikes radiating from the edges.  On physical examination, this lump usually feels much harder or firmer than benign breast lesions such as fibroadenoma.  On microscopic examination, the cancerous cells invade and replace the surrounding normal tissues.  IDC is divided in several histological subtypes.   Section::::Signs and symptoms. \n In many cases, ductal carcinoma is asymptomatic, and detected as abnormal results on mammography. When symptoms occur, a painless, enlarging mass that does not fluctuate with the menstrual period may be felt.  Pinching of the overlying skin may also be seen.  Certain subtypes, such as inflammatory carcinomas, may result in a swollen, enlarged and tender breast.  All variants of cancer, if there is metastatic spread, may cause enlarged lymph nodes and affect other organs.    Section::::Causes.   The cancer may form from the precancerous lesion called ductal carcinoma in situ.   Section::::Diagnosis.   Section::::Diagnosis.:Tumor size.   Tumors under 1 cm in diameter are unlikely to spread systemically.  Tumors are staged by size.   Section::::Diagnosis.:Lymph node involvement.   Absence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes is a good indication that the cancer has not spread systemically.  Presence of cancer in the lymph nodes indicates the cancer may have spread.  In studies, some women have had presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, were not treated with chemotherapy, and still did not have a systemic spread.  Therefore, lymph node involvement is not a positive predictor of spread.   Section::::Diagnosis.:Clinical staging.   Tumor size staging and node involvement staging can be combined into a single clinical staging number.   Section::::Diagnosis.:Histologic appearance. \n The appearance of cancer cells under a microscope is another predictor of systemic spread. The more different the cancer cells look compared to normal duct cells, the greater the risk of systemic spread.  There are three characteristics that differentiate cancer cells from normal cells.   BULLET::::1.  Tendency to form tubular structures  BULLET::::2.  Nuclear size, shape, and staining intensity  BULLET::::3.  Mitotic rate - Rate of cell division  The histologic appearance of cancer cells can be scored on these three parameters on a scale from one to three.  The sum of these grades is a number between 3 and 9.  The score is called a Bloom Richardson Grade (BR) and is expressed [  sum of the grades]/9.  For example, cells that were graded 2 on all three parameters would result in a BR score of 6/9.   A score of 5 and under is considered Low.  6 to 7 is considered Intermediate. 8 to 9 is considered High.   Section::::Diagnosis.:Vascular invasion.   The presence of cancer cell in small blood vessels is called vascular invasion.  The presence of vascular invasion increases the probability of systemic spread.   Section::::Diagnosis.:DNA analysis.   DNA analysis indicates the amount of DNA in cancer cells and how fast the cancer is growing.   Cells with the normal amount of DNA are called diploid. \nCells with too much or too little DNA are called aneuploid. Aneuploid cells are more likely to spread than diploid cells.   DNA testings indicates the rate of growth by determining the number of cells in the synthetic phase (S Phase).  An S Phase  10% means a higher chance of spreading.   The results of DNA testing are considered less reliable predictors of spread than size, histology, and lymph node involvement.   Section::::Prognosis.   According to the NIH Consensus Conference , if DCIS is allowed to go untreated, the natural course or natural history varies according to the grade of the DCIS.  Unless treated, approximately 60 percent of low-grade DCIS lesions will have become invasive at 40 years follow-up.  High-grade DCIS lesions that have been inadequately resected and not given radiotherapy have a 50 percent risk of becoming invasive breast cancer within seven years.  Approximately half of low-grade DCIS detected at screening will represent overdiagnosis, but overdiagnosis of high-grade DCIS is rare.  The natural history of intermediate-grade DCIS is difficult to predict.  Approximately one-third of malignant calcification clusters detected at screening mammography already have an invasive focus.   The prognosis of IDC depends, in part, on its histological subtype. \nMucinous, papillary, cribriform, and tubular carcinomas have longer survival, and lower recurrence rates. The prognosis of the most common form of IDC, called \"IDC Not Otherwise Specified\", is intermediate.  Finally, some rare forms of breast cancer (e.g., sarcomatoid carcinoma, inflammatory carcinoma) have a poor prognosis.  Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu.   These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread.  The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile.  The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents.   Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003.   Section::::Treatment.   Treatment of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) depends on the size of the mass (size of the tumor measured in its longest direction):  BULLET::::- <4 cm mass: surgery to remove the main tumor mass and to sample the lymph nodes in the axilla. \nThe stage of the tumor is ascertained after this first surgery. Adjuvant therapy (i.e., treatment after surgery) may include a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen) and/or targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab).  More surgery is occasionally needed to complete the removal of the initial tumor or to remove recurrences.   BULLET::::- 4 cm or larger mass: modified (a less aggressive form of radical mastectomy) radical mastectomy (because any malignant mass in excess of 4 cm in size exceeds the criteria for a lumpectomy) along with sampling of the lymph nodes in the axilla.   The treatment options offered to an individual patient are determined by the form, stage and location of the cancer, and also by the age, history of prior disease and general health of the patient.  Not all patients are treated the same way.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- Atypical ductal hyperplasia  BULLET::::- Collagenous spherulosis  Section::::External links.

{"id":"KILT_48579721","text":" Soil regeneration  Soil regeneration as a particular form of ecological regeneration within the field of restoration ecology is the act or idea of replenishing the Earth's soil with beneficial nutrients (including carbon) using natural methods.  The focus—building soil health—has many benefits, both proven and theorized, including the soil sequestration of carbon in response to a growing threat of climate change.   Section::::Climate change and the carbon cycle.   There has been much evidence to show a significant connection between the carbon cycle and climate change.  Most greenhouse gases are primarily composed of carbon and they produce an effect where warmer air that is heated by the sun is kept from leaving the atmosphere by forming a barrier in the troposphere.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, greenhouse gasses produced by human activity have been noted as the most significant cause of global climate change since the 1950s.  Without human interaction, carbon is removed from and reintroduced to soil through a variety of ecosystem processes known as the carbon cycle.  Humans have been significantly influencing the global carbon cycle since the Industrial Revolution through various means, such as transportation and agriculture.  Through these actions, most of this carbon has moved in one direction, from the lithosphere and biospheres to the atmosphere. \nBy means of oil, gas and irresponsible farming, much of the natural carbon in the earth's pedosphere has been released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gasses.  Section::::Regenerative agriculture.   Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history.  Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing.  Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification.  Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time.  Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil.  It includes \"permaculture\", originally being a combination of the words \"permanent\" and \"agriculture\", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem.  Permaculture focuses on using the land and a strong knowledge of plants, animals and natural cycles to create ecosystems that yield plentiful produce and help keep themselves healthy and productive. \nThis can be done through intentional landscaping that would utilize as much rainfall as possible or placing nitrogen fixing plants near another crop that might need them. Agroecology also includes the ideas of holistic management.  This approach stems from the work of Allan Savory who claims that planned grazing can improve soil health and reverse the effects of desertification.   Monoculture is a style of agriculture where only one type of crop is harvested in a field season after season.  This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has a specific set of nutrients that it need to grow or can replace back into the soil.  With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed, leaving none of those in the soil, and only certain others will be returned into the land, leaving large gaps in the richness required to maintain a healthy level of production.  Permaculture and holistic management are two different methods that focus on increasing biomass and returning nutrient richness and diversity to the soil.  The more biomass that is present in an ongoing cycle, the more carbon that can be sequestered into the soil and that can be converted into oxygen by plant matter.  To accomplish these goals, permaculture encourages the idea of planting more than one crop on a piece of land at a time. \nAny combination of plants that are chosen to grow together in a permaculture garden or farm would help the other plants be more healthy and grow as well. In permaculture design, each individual aspect of a farm would help other aspects attain the necessary nutrients and conditions to be as plentiful as possible.  This helps to regenerate soil health because the diversity of the crops and even livestock used would help maintain a balance of all necessary nutrients, including carbon.  Holistic management focuses mainly onn increasing biomass through the carefully planned grazing of livestock.  The idea behind holistic management is that grazing livestock can actually help improve the growing conditions for more biomass through means such as naturally fertilizing the land and tilling with hooves.

{"id":"KILT_1609007","text":" Christian poetry  Christian poetry is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references.  The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold.  Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory.   Section::::Overview of Christian poetry.   Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins.  The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament.  Canticles such as the \"Magnificat\" and \"Nunc Dimittis\", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models.  Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles.  Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle:  Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism. \nPaul quotes the pagan poets Aratus and Epimenides in Acts 17:28: \"For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as certain also of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'\" Some early Christian poets such as Ausonius continued to include allusions to pagan deities and standard classical figures and allusions continued to appear in his verse. Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms.   Other early Christian poets were more innovative.  The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the \"Vexilla Regis\" (\"The Royal Standard\") and \"Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis\" (\"Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle\").  From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies.   A related issue concerned the literary quality of Christian scripture. \nMost of the New Testament was written (or translated from a semitic language) in a sub-literary variety of \"koinê\" Greek, as was the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament. The Old Latin Bible added further solecisms to those found in its source texts.  None of the Christian scriptures were written to suit the tastes of those who were educated in classical Greek or Latin rhetoric.  Educated pagans, seeing the sub-literary quality of the Christian scriptures, posed a problem for Christian apologists: why did the Holy Ghost write so badly?  Some Christian writers such as Tertullian flatly rejected classical standards of rhetoric; \"what has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\" he asked.   The cultural prestige of classical literary standards was not so easy for other Christians to overcome.  St Jerome, trained in the classical Latin rhetoric of Cicero, observed that dismay over the quality of existing Latin Bible translations was a major motivating factor that induced him to produce the Vulgate, which went on to become the standard Latin Bible, and remains the official Bible translation of the Roman Catholic Church. \nA fuller appreciation of the formal literary virtues of Biblical poetry remained unavailable for European Christians until 1754, when Robert Lowth (later made a bishop in the Church of England), kinder to the Hebrew language than his own, published \"Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum\", which identified parallelism as the chief rhetorical device within Hebrew poetry.  In many European vernacular literatures, Christian poetry appears among the earliest monuments of those literatures, and Biblical paraphrases in verse often precede Bible translations.  In Old English poetry, the \"Dream of the Rood\", a meditation on Christ's crucifixion which adapts Germanic heroic imagery and applies it to Jesus, is one of the earliest extant monuments of Old English literature.  Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" represents one of the earliest monuments of Italian vernacular literature.  Much Old Irish poetry was the work of Irish monks and is on religious themes.  This story is repeated in most European languages.   Modern Christian poetry especially suffers from a difficulty of definition.  The writings of a Christian poet are not necessarily classified as Christian poetry.  The themes of poetry are necessarily hard to pin down, and what some see as a Christian theme or viewpoint may not be seen by others. \nA number of modern writers are widely considered to have Christian themes in much of their poetry, including William Blake, G. K. Chesterton and T. S. Eliot.  Section::::Examples of Christian poets.   The following list is chronological by birth year.

{"id":"KILT_7428553","text":" Career portfolio  Career portfolios are used to plan, organize and document education, work samples and skills.  People use career portfolios to apply for jobs, apply to college or training programs.  They are more in-depth than a resume, which is used to summarize the above in one or two pages.  Career portfolios serve as proof of one's skills, abilities, and potential in the future.   Career portfolios are becoming common in high schools, college, and workforce development.    Career portfolios help with a job or acceptance into higher education institutes.  A career portfolio should be personal and contain critical information.  Items that should be included include (but are not limited to) personal information, evaluations, sample work, a business portrait, and awards and acknowledgments.  Career portfolios are often kept in a simple three-ring binder or online as an electronic portfolio and updated often.  A career portfolio is used as a marketing tool in selling oneself for personal advancement.  In some industries, employers or admission offices commonly request a career portfolio, so it is a wise idea to have an updated one on hand.   Section::::Online portfolio.   In the 21st century has filtered its way into portfolios especially in the digital work place job market. \nWhile traditional C.V. style portfolios still dominate the portfolio world it is common to back it up with a website containing personal statements, contact details and experience.  More and more job seekers are building personally branded websites to validate and distinguish their skills, accomplishments, and experiences.  Social web sites such as LinkedIn have become popular, as have services from websites which offer to host portfolios for clients.  These web services provide users the tools to include all forms of digital media in their websites, including documents, images, videos, and audio files.   Resume reels and demo tapes are a type of portfolio.  They are used by many in the arts such as musicians, actors, artists and even journalists.   Creative Professionals are also looking to portfolio websites as a means of presenting their work in a more professional and elegant manner.[This entire section needs citations.  The section sounds like an author's generalization, not necessarily the truth in the marketplace around actual online portfolios.]  Section::::Industries.   A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists.  An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. \nArt Portfolios, sometimes called \"artfolios\", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs.  For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture.    Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills.  Talent portfolios can also include video.   Animators typically use demo reels, also known as \"demo tapes\", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers.  Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs.  Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works.   In industries that do not commonly use portfolios, a portfolio can be a way to stand out from the competition during job interviews.  For example, programmers can use portfolios in addition to a resume in order to showcase their best work and highlight challenging projects.   Another type of industry that can use portfolios as a developmental tool are schools at various levels. \nTeachers can use these portfolios as an asset to themselves and to their students. Students typically can use portfolios as a tool to select the types of work that they would like to include, reflect on the course work to make connections between the units learned, and to help them learn critical thinking skills which is developed during the reflecting and selecting processes.  For teachers, however, they are able to put controls on their student's portfolios to help the students throughout the portfolio process.  Once the portfolios are completed by each student, the educators of the particular subject is able to look through each portfolio and find any areas that are commonly struggled on by the students.  Once this common trouble area in a unit is found, the teacher can now figure out a new way/ adjust the assignments or teaching strategies that were used to educate the students on that particular subject area.   Section::::Types of Portfolios.   The three major types of portfolios are: working portfolios, display portfolios, and assessment portfolios.  Although the types are distinct in theory, they tend to overlap in practice.  Consequently, a district's program may include several different types of portfolios, serving several different purposes. \nAs a result, it is important for educators to be clear about their goals, the reasons they are engaging in a portfolio project, and the intended audience for the portfolios.

{"id":"KILT_1117403","text":" Goliath frog  The goliath frog otherwise known as goliath bullfrog or giant slippery frog (\"Conraua goliath\") is the largest living frog on Earth.  Specimens can grow up to 32 cm (12.6 in) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kg (7.17 lb).  This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.  Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.   Section::::Description.   In a sample of 15 individuals, weights ranged between , and snout-vent lengths were between .  Their eyes can be nearly in diameter.  The conspicuous tympanum has a diameter around and is separated from the eye by about in adults.  Goliath frog eggs and tadpoles are about the same size as other frogs despite their very large adult form.   A lateral fold extends from the eye to the posterior portion of the tympanum.  Toes are fully webbed, with large interdigital membranes extending down to the toe tips.  The second toe is the longest.  The skin on the dorsum and on top of the limbs is granular.  Dorsal coloration is green sienna, while the abdomen and ventral part of the limbs are yellow/orange. \nThey have acute hearing, but no vocal sac, and also lack nuptial pads.  Section::::Distribution and habitat.   The goliath frog is normally found in and near fast-flowing rivers with sandy bottoms in the Middle African countries of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.  These rivers are usually clear and highly oxygenated.  Their actual range spans from the last of the Sanaga basin in Cameroon to the north to the last of the Benito River basin in Equatorial Guinea to the south.  The river systems in which these frogs live are often found in dense, extremely humid areas with relatively high temperatures.   Section::::Ecology and behavior.   Section::::Ecology and behavior.:Reproduction.   Like most amphibians, water is vital for their reproduction.  Because the goliath frog lacks a vocal sac, it does not produce mating calls, a behavior generally present in frogs and toads.  Males construct spawning and breeding areas alongside and within rivers by pushing rocks into semicircular patterns.  The egg masses consist of several hundred eggs, approximately each, attached to vegetation at the bottom of rivers.  Larval development takes between 85 and 95 days.   Section::::Ecology and behavior.:Diet.   Goliath tadpoles are herbivorous and feed on a single aquatic plant, \"Dicraeia warmingii\" (Podostemaceae), found only near waterfalls and rapids, which may help explain their restricted range. \nAdult goliath frogs feed on spiders, worms, and insects, such as dragonflies and locusts. They also eat smaller frogs, crabs, baby turtles, and young snakes.  A bat reportedly was found in a goliath frog's stomach.   Section::::Ecology and behavior.:Longevity.   The goliath frog can live up to 15 years in the wild.  In captivity, they can live up to 21 years.  It is preyed upon by snakes, Nile crocodiles, Nile monitors, and Humans among other predators.   Section::::Conservation.   The primary threat to the goliath frog is hunting, as it is considered a food source in its native range.  The IUCN has highlighted the need for conservation measures, in cooperation with local communities, to make sure the hunting is at sustainable levels.  To a lesser extent they are also threatened by habitat loss and degradation.  They were extensively exported to zoos and the pet trade, but have proven shy and nervous in captivity.  Although captives may live longer than their wild counterparts, the species has not been bred in captivity.  Due to their classification as an endangered species, the Equatorial Guinean government has declared that no more than 300 goliaths may be exported per year for the pet trade, but few now seem to be exported from this country.

Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker.  Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages.   Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value.  Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products.   Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked).  Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production.   Section::::Standard operation.   Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use.  The moistened soy beans are placed into the grinding chamber, where they are ground into a fine paste, and fall into a finely screened strainer chamber immersed in a pot of water. \n The paste is steeped in the water in a process similar to that of tea making; the pot of water is heated, fully cooking both the dissolved soy milk and the strained soy solids, which become soy pulp. The new models on the market now have no filter cup — soy beans are placed directly inside the machine jug.   Most soy milk makers include a mechanism to stop the boiling soy milk from overflowing.  The heater is turned off as the water level approaches the top of the chamber, and then turned back on as the soy milk returns to an acceptable level.  This process is repeated for the length of the cooking period, which lasts for approximately fifteen minutes.   When the soy milk has fully cooked, the machine will automatically turn off, leaving the soy pulp in the filter cup and the soy milk in the water chamber.  Many machines will beep to inform the user of the soy milk's completion.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- List of cooking appliances  Section::::External links.

{"id":"KILT_1295452","text":" Gas-generator cycle  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle.   There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.   The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine.  This is seen in the F-1 rocket engine used on the Saturn V booster stage.   As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling). \n The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.  Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.  Engines using this system are mechanically simple, but have poor specific impulse.   Section::::Usage.

{"id":"KILT_18522361","text":" Urban runoff  Urban runoff is surface runoff of rainwater created by urbanization.  This runoff is a major source of flooding and water pollution in urban communities worldwide.   Impervious surfaces (roads, parking lots and sidewalks) are constructed during land development.  During rain storms and other precipitation events, these surfaces (built from materials such as asphalt and concrete), along with rooftops, carry polluted stormwater to storm drains, instead of allowing the water to percolate through soil.  This causes lowering of the water table (because groundwater recharge is lessened) and flooding since the amount of water that remains on the surface is greater.  Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers and bays.  This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.   Section::::Urban flooding.   Urban runoff is a major cause of urban flooding, the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as storm sewers. \nTriggered by events such as flash flooding, storm surges, overbank flooding, or snow melt, urban flooding is characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities, regardless of whether or not these communities are located within formally designated floodplains or near any body of water.  There are several ways in which stormwater enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes.  Where properties are built with basements, urban flooding is the primary cause of basement flooding.   Flood flows in urban environments have been investigated relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.  Some researchers mentioned the storage effect in urban areas.  Several studies looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication in terms of flood modelling.  Some recent research considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas.  But some recent field measurements during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by the velocity and water depth fluctuations. \nThese considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion.  Section::::Pollutants.   Water running off these impervious surfaces tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as fertilizers and pesticides from lawns.  Roads and parking lots are major sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels, as well as of the heavy metals nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead.  Roof runoff contributes high levels of synthetic organic compounds and zinc (from galvanized gutters).  Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of nitrates and phosphorus in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.   Eroding soils or poorly maintained construction sites can often lead to increased sedimentation in runoff.  Sedimentation often settles to the bottom of water bodies and can directly affect water quality.  Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil.  These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. \nLimited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and suspended solids have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well.  Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface.  Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs.  This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.   Runoff can also induce heavy metal poisoning in ocean life.  Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans.  These metals are ingested by ocean life.  These heavy metals cannot be disposed so they accumulate within the animals.  Over time, these metals build up to a toxic level, and the animal dies.  This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans.  If we eat a poisoned animal, we have a chance of getting heavy metal poisoning too.   As stormwater is channeled into storm drains and surface waters, the natural sediment load discharged to receiving waters decreases, but the water flow and velocity increases.  In fact, the impervious cover in a typical city creates five times the runoff of a typical woodland of the same size.   Section::::Effects. \n A 2008 report by the United States National Research Council (textbox below) identified urban runoff as a leading source of water quality problems.  ...further declines in water quality remain likely if the land-use changes that typify more diffuse sources of pollution are not addressed...  These include land-disturbing agricultural, silvicultural, urban, industrial, and construction activities from which hard-to-monitor pollutants emerge during wet-weather events.  Pollution from these landscapes has been almost universally acknowledged as the most pressing challenge to the restoration of waterbodies and aquatic ecosystems nationwide.     – National Research Council, \"Urban Stormwater Management in the United States\"  The runoff also increases temperatures in streams, harming fish and other organisms.  (A sudden burst of runoff from a rainstorm can cause a fish-killing shock of hot water.)  Also, road salt used to melt snow on sidewalks and roadways can contaminate streams and groundwater aquifers.   One of the most pronounced effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called \"ephemeral streams\").  When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. \nContaining little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches at the mouth of a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.   Because of fertilizer and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, eutrophication often occurs in waterways affected by this type of runoff.  After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of algae blooms that soon consume most of the oxygen.  Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication.  Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures.  Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.   Excessive stream bank erosion may cause flooding and property damage.  For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by river engineering through construction of hardened embankments and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. \nUse of these hard materials destroys habitat for fish and other animals. Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream.   Urban flooding has significant economic implications.  In the US, industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10%-25% and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.  According to the U.S Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), almost 40% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.  In the UK, urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year in England and Wales; 80,000 homes are at risk.   A study of Cook County, Illinois, identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96% of the county's ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007-2011.  This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim.  Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.   Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere. \nNumerous watersheds within Los Angeles County, California do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management.   Section::::Prevention and mitigation.   Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges.  A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff.  Some of these techniques (called best management practices (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.   /div  Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels & oil, fertilizers and pesticides).  Runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, retention basins and similar devices. \n Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management.  Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues.   The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff.  Street sweeping vacuums collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.   Educational programs can also be an effective tool for managing urban runoff.  Local businesses and individuals can have an integral role in reducing pollution in urban runoff simply through their practices, but often are unaware of regulations.  Creating a productive discussion on urban runoff and the importance of effective disposal of household items can help to encourage environmentally friendly practices at a reduced cost to the city and local economy.

{"id":"KILT_11463948","text":" RD-270  RD-270 (, Rocket Engine 270, 8D420) was a single-chamber liquid-bipropellant rocket engine designed by Energomash (USSR) in 1960–1970.  It was to be used on the first stages of proposed heavy-lift UR-700 and UR-900 rocket families.  It has the highest thrust among single-chamber engines of the USSR, 640 metric tons at the surface of Earth.  The propellants used are unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NO).  The chamber pressure was among the highest considered, being about 26 MPa.  This was achieved by applying full-flow staged combustion cycle for all the incoming mass of fuel, which is turned into a gas and passes through a couple of turbines before being burned in the combustion chamber.  This allowed the engine to achieve a specific impulse of at the Earth's surface.   The engine testing was underway when the decision was made to cancel the program.  The development of it was stopped with all other work on corresponding rocket projects on 11 December 1970.   Section::::History.   The development of RD-270 started on 26 June 1962.  Preliminary investigations and development of the engine and its further production were performed under the guidance of Valentin Glushko and finished in 1967. \nIt became the most powerful engine in the world with use of high-boiling propellant to date. During 1967–1969, several test firings were performed with experimental engines that were adapted to work at sea level and had a short nozzle.  In total, 27 test firings were performed with 22 engines, three engines were tested twice, and one of them was tested three times.  All works stopped later together with corresponding activities on the UR-700 project.   During development, Glushko studied the use of pentaborane \"zip\" propellants in a modified RD-270M engine.  This would have created immense toxicity problems but increased the specific impulse of the engine by .   Section::::Design.   The engine throttle range was 95–105%, the thrust vector control range was ±12° (project R-56) and ±8° for UR-700 rocket family.  The oxidizer-to-fuel ratio was 2.67 and can be changed by up to 7%.   To achieve such a high specific impulse and pressure in combustion chamber as RD-270 has, two circuits of full-flow staged combustion cycle were applied.  The pair of turbines with preburners turns the fuel into the gaseous form and circulates all of the fuel components. \nOne of the turbines uses the fuel-rich gas to power a fuel pump, another one uses the oxidizer-rich gas to power the oxidizer pump. As a result, the main combustion chamber (MCC) burns only generator gas.  The engine controller regulates the functions of the two independent fuel and oxidizer circuits.   With the purpose to cool \"MCC\" it has layered wall structure with four internal belts of slots.  Some parts of nozzles are covered by zirconium dioxide for thermal protection.

{"id":"KILT_56710049","text":" Off-target genome editing  Off-target genome editing refers to nonspecific and unintended genetic modifications that can arise through the use of engineered nuclease technologies such as: clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFN).  These tools use different mechanisms to bind a predetermined sequence of DNA (“target”), which they cleave (or \"cut\"), creating a double-stranded chromosomal break (DSB) that summons the cells DNA repair mechanisms (non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)) and leads to site-specific modifications.  If these complexes do not bind at the target, often a result of homologous sequences and/or mismatch tolerance, they will cleave off-target DSB and cause non-specific genetic modifications.  Specifically, off-target effects consist of unintended point mutations, deletions, insertions inversions, and translocations.   Designer nuclease systems such as CRISPR-cas9 are becoming increasingly popular research tools as a result of their simplicity, scalability and affordability.  With this being said, off-target genetic modifications are frequent and can alter the function of otherwise intact genes. \nMultiple studies using early CRISPR-cas9 agents found that greater than 50% of RNA-guided endonuclease-induced mutations were not occurring on-target. The Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) recognizes a 20 bp target DNA sequence, which it binds and cleaves to ‘edit’ the DNA sequence.  However, target sequence binding can tolerate mismatches up to several base pairs, meaning there are often thousands of possible binding sites which present several experimental and safety concerns.  In the research sphere off-target effects can confound variables in biological studies leading to potentially misleading and non-reproducible results.  In the clinical sphere the major concerns surround the disruption of vital coding regions leading to genotoxic effects such as cancer.  Accordingly, the improvement of the specificity of genome editing tools and the detection of off-target effects are rapidly progressing research areas.  Such research incorporates designer nuclease development and discovery, computational prediction programs and databases, and high-throughput sequencing to reduce and anticipate mutational occurrence.  Many designer nuclease tools are still in their relative infancy and as their molecular properties and \"in vivo\" behaviors become better understood they will become increasingly precise and predictable.   Section::::Mechanisms.   The CRISPR-Cas9 system works as the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. \nWhen a virus infects the bacteria, this system incorporates segments of the viral DNA into the bacterial genome. Upon a second invasion, transcripts from these sequences direct a nuclease activity to its complementary sequence in the invading virus so as to destroy it.   In order to extrapolate this method into eukaryotes in order to develop a gene editing method, a Cas9 protein, a recognition sequence RNA, and a transactivating RNA are required.  The fusion of both the recognition sequence specificity CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating RNA (tracrRNA) is commonly used in experiments and called a single guide RNA (sgRNA).  It performs both functions - first 20 nucleotides of the sgRNA are complementary to the DNA target sequence while the nucleotides following are part of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).   Off-targeting nuclease binding originates from a partial but sufficient match to the target sequence.  Off-target binding mechanisms can be grouped into two main forms: base mismatch tolerance, and bulge mismatch.   Section::::Mechanisms.:Base mismatch tolerance.   While the Cas9 specificity is believed to be controlled by the 20nt sgRNA and PAM, off-target mutations are still prevalent and could occur with as small as 3-5 base pair mismatches between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence. \nFurthermore, sgRNA secondary structures could also affect cleavage of on-target and off-target sites. As mentioned above, sgRNA consists of a sequence (~20nt) which is complementary to the target sequences and this is followed by a PAM sequence which activates the endonuclease activity.  While it was shown that 10-12 nt adjacent to PAM (called the “seed sequence”) was enough for Cas9 specificity, Wu \"et al.\"  showed that in a catalytically dead Cas9 only 1-5 base pairs of seed sequence is required for specificity.  This was later proven by other studies as well.  The Cas9 protein binding is further affected by a number of mechanisms:  BULLET::::- The seed sequence determines the frequency of a seed plus PAM in the genome and controls the effective concentration of Cas9 sgRNA complex.   BULLET::::- Uracil-rich seeds are likely to have low sgRNA levels and increase specificity since multiple uracil in the sequence can introduce termination of the sgRNA transcription.   BULLET::::- Mismatches in the 5’ end of the crRNA are more tolerated as the important site would be adjacent to the PAM matrix.  Single and double mismatches are also tolerated based on how to place it.   BULLET::::- In a recent study, Ren \"et al.\"  observed a link between mutagenesis efficiency and GC content of sgRNA. \nAt least 4-6bp adjacent to the PAM are required for a good edit.  BULLET::::- While picking a gRNA, guanine is preferred over cytosine as the first base of the seed adjacent to PAM, cytosine as the first in the 5’ and adenine in the middle of the sequence.  This design is based on stability linked to formation of G quadruplexes.   BULLET::::- A ChIP was performed by Kim \"et al.\"  showcasing that addition of a purified Cas9 along with the sgRNA caused low off target effects which means that there are more factors causing these effects.   It is important to note that DNA methylation of CpG sites reduces efficiency of binding of Cas9 and other factors in cells.  Therefore, there is an epigenetic link which will be explored more for the future of epigenome editing.  Sequence of PAM can also affect sgRNA activity in turn affecting the sgRNA itself.  In commonly used Cas9 systems the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides.  The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity problems as some regions will have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. \nA report stated that 99.96% of sites previously assumed to be unique Cas9 targets in human exons may have potential off target effects containing NAG or NGG PAM and a single base mismatch in the seed sequence.  Section::::Mechanisms.:Bulge mismatch.   Both off target sites with missing bases (or deletions) and off target sites with extra bases (or insertions) called RNA bulge and DNA bulge respectively, have effects in Cas9 specificity and cleavage activity.  Lin \"et al.\"  mimicked these bulges by adding and deleting bases from the sgRNA sequence such that a base deletion in the sgRNA would yield an RNA bulge and a base insertion would yield a DNA bulge.  By studying the mutation rates via NHEJ, they came to the following results:  BULLET::::- In case of pure DNA bulges, the mutations were well tolerated (i.e. Cas9 cleavage activity was still prevalent).  The regions of bulge tolerance included seven bases from the PAM and the 5’ and 3’ ends of the seed sequence.  This resulted in similar or slightly higher (in some cases) mutations as compared to zero bulges.   BULLET::::- In case of purely RNA bulges, higher Cas9 activity was induced at many positions as compared to DNA bulges. \nThis characteristic was attributed to the fact that RNA is more flexible than DNA and thus has a smaller binding penalty with RNA bulge resulting in a higher tolerance and higher off target mutations.  BULLET::::- Higher GC content of the sgRNA sequence resulted in a higher tolerance and thus, a higher off target mutation rate.   BULLET::::- Bulges of 2bp-5bp strikingly were more tolerant and mutation inducing than a single 2bp bulge.   Section::::Improvements.   Section::::Improvements.:Methods to increase specificity.   The widely used \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies.  Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off-target mutations including nuclease mutation, protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence modification, guide RNA (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery.  For example, in 2013, Fu \"et al.\"  reported that by truncating the gRNA from 20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred.   Section::::Improvements.:Methods to increase specificity.:Cas9 nickases.   The spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. \nNuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as Cas9 nickases. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage.  Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands.  Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co-localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target indels.  Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions.   Section::::Improvements.:Methods to increase specificity.:Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases.   As monomeric nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, dimerization is an attractive strategy.  In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or ‘half-sites’ and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off-target effects.  A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization-dependent FokI nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed.  The FokI nuclease was originally found in \"Flavobacterium okeanokoites\", and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. \nBasically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9). The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1.  It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing.   Section::::Improvements.:Methods to increase specificity.:Nuclease mutation.   In addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM.  In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides.  The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification.  The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects.  A D1135E mutant appears to alter PAM specificities.  The D1135E mutant reduces off-target effects and increases the specificity of SpCas9.  An additional variant, SpCas9-HF1, also results in favorable improvements to Cas9 specificity. \nSeveral combinations of substitutions known to form non-specific DNA contacts (N497A, R661A, Q695A, and Q926A) have been identified. A quadruple substitution of these residues (later named SpCas9-HF1), has extremely low levels of off-target effects as detected by GUIDE-seq experiments.  Variants such as SpCas9-HF1 and D1135E, and others like it can be combined, tested and readily added to existing SpCas9 vectors to reduce the rates of off-target mutations.  Additionally, many of the engineering strategies listed above can be combined to create increasingly robust and reliable RNA-guided nuclease editing tools.   Section::::Improvements.:Methods to increase specificity.:CRISPRi and CRISPRa.   CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) have also been developed.  These systems can precisely alter gene transcription at the DNA level without inflicting irreversible genetic alterations.  Furthermore, by directly acting on DNA they are generally more specific and predictable compared to RNAi.  Although CRISPRi/a cannot replace genome editing in all experiments, they can act as effective alternatives in some cases.  CRISPRi and CRISPRa use a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme that cannot cut DNA, but can deliver transcriptional activators and repressors to modulate desired gene expression with high precision. \nCurrently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible.  CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences.  Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA.  The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations.   Section::::Detection.   Even though one might take careful measures to avoid off-target mutations, and even if one succeeds, a confirmatory screen needs to be done in order to screen for unintended mutations.  Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two \"in vitro\" methods.  All of these are listed below:  Section::::Detection.:Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing. \n In case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time consuming and expensive once more target sites are added.  Exome sequencing utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome.  It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome.  In case of whole genome sequencing, the entire genome is screened for off target mutations.  Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences.   Section::::Detection.:BLESS.   BLESS is the easiest way to detect and quantify off-target mutations by screening for DSBs in the genome.  This method relies on direct \"in situ\" breaks labeling enrichment on streptavidin.  Developed in 2013, BLESS is performed by ligating the DSB ends with biotin i.e. biotinylation.  This is followed by separation/collection of said ligated ends using streptavidin.  A linked sequence is added to the biotinylated sequences and this final mix is then sequenced to yield the position of the off target mutation. \nBeing unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired.   Section::::Detection.:LAM-HTGTS.   Linear Amplification Mediated - High Throughput Genome Wide Translocation Sequencing, or LAM-HTGTS, is a method developed to track translocation events caused by joining between DSBs.  Developed to detect off-target mutations from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, this technique is based on DNA repair by end joining in DSBs.  Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations.  Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved.  Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation.  Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers.  In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence.  The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations.  One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB.   Section::::Detection.:GUIDE-  Seq. \n Another approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the GUIDE-seq method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DsBs Enables by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ.  Its amplification is followed by sequencing.  Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified.  Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation.  This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%.  Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study.   Section::::Detection.:Digenome-Seq.   One of the current \"in vitro\" methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome.  In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing.  Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned.  Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%. \nThe main advantage, however, is that this method is \"in vitro\" i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well.   Section::::Detection.:CIRCLE-Seq.   The latest addition to the \"in vitro\" methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq.  Licensed by Beacon genomics (along with GUIDE-seq), CIRCLE-seq aims to remove the drawbacks of Digenome-seq such as the need for a large sample size and read depth (~400 millions reads) and the high background that makes identification of low frequency cleavage events harder.  It adopts a restriction enzyme independent strategy to create and select conversion of randomly sheared DNA.  On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing.  While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available(which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). \nNearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side.   Section::::Significance.   Section::::Significance.:Gene therapy.   In order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete.  The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern especially during clinical trials as if any off-target modifications are detected the further development of a candidate product can be blocked.  Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma.  To limit the rate of off-target cleavage the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN which has proven to have little to no background off-target interaction.  CAR-T immunotherapy is an \"ex vivo\" procedure, which means that the patient's immune cells (in this case T-cells) are extracted and edited using designer nucleases. \nWhile TALEN system development is expensive and time consuming, research and engineering modifications have drastically limited their rate of off-target interaction. However, patients receiving the treatment are still monitored frequently and will be for the next 15 years so that off-target effects and immunogenic responses can be analyzed and brought into consideration as new gene therapies are brought to clinical trial.   Section::::Significance.:Gene therapy.:CCR5 ZFN-modified autologous helper T cell trials.   A phase I/II clinical trial enrolled 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to test the safety and effectiveness of administering ZFN-modified autologous helper T cells.  Through targeted deletions, the custom ZFN disables the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (\"CCR5\") gene, which encodes a co-receptor that is used by the HIV virus to enter the cell.  As a result of the high degree of sequence homology between C-C chemokine receptors this ZFN also cleaves \"CCR2\", leading to off-target ∼15kb deletions and genomic rearrangements.  The impacts of these \"CCR2\" modifications are still not known, and to date there have been no reported side effects however, \"CCR2\" is known to have many critical roles in neural, and metabolic systems.   Section::::Significance.:Gene Drives. \n Engineered gene drives using CRISPR-cas9 are currently being tested and have been proposed as strategies to eliminate invasive species and disease vectors. By genetically modifying an organism to express an endogenous sequence-specific endonuclease, a target (such as a fertility gene) can be cleaved on the opposite chromosome.  A DSB at the target leads to homologous repair which effectively renders the organism homozygous for the desired target sequence.  This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility.  However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely.  With every subsequent generation, off-target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic.  Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression.  In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes.   Section::::Controversy.   The increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies.   Section::::Controversy.:Schaefer \"et al.\"  2017. \n On May 30, 2017 a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target SNVs and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an \"in vivo\" gene repair experiment. The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain (\"rd1\") by correcting the Y347X mutation in the \"Pde6b\" gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system.  After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes.  Greater than 1,600 SNVs, and 128 indels were discovered.  Exactly 1,397 SNVs and 117 indels overlapped between the two edited mice, suggesting that the off-target effects were not random in origin.  Additionally, algorithms attempting to predicting the location of the off-target mutations failed to correctly predict an overwhelming majority.  For a point of reference, in 2016 a whole exome sequencing study found 19 SNVs and 3 indels in 5 edited mice, while Schaefer \"et al.\"  found 115 exonic SNVs and 9 indels in just 2 edited mice. \nMany experts disagreed with the paper and criticized through journal articles and social media, suggesting that unusual CRISPR treatments were used in the initial paper and the sample size was too low for significance (n=2). Nature Methods has issued two editorial notes on the paper.  Nonetheless, off-target rates are consistently found to be more frequent \"in vivo\" compared to cell culture experiments, and are thought to be particularly common in humans.

{"id":"KILT_34083174","text":" Mental health care in South Africa  Mental illness is very prevalent in South Africa, yet the country lacks many of the necessary resources and policies needed to execute an effective mental health strategy.  Many factors including violence, communicable disease, and urbanisation have increased the prevalence of mental disorders in the country.  The way in which these mental disorders are treated has changed over the years.   For a while, mental health care was mainly institutionalised.  However, in 1997, following the White Paper Act, the South African government moved to deinstitutionalize mental health care and relegate it to the primary care setting.  However, current data indicates that the goal of deinstitutionalization and effective primary mental care has still not been fulfilled.    African Traditional Medicine still plays a huge role in African society.  Even though it often functions in an inhibitory manner, a comprehensive health plan with a focus on collaboration between traditional practices and Western medicine could prove very beneficial.  Another factor regarding the very nature of mental disorders complicates this issue even further.    A complete cure of a mental disorder is nebulous and can only be attained gradually with time.  For this reason, mental illness is hard to cure among such a paucity of resources.  Without the necessary intermediate care and continuity in therapy, many patients regress when released from the hospital. \n Section::::Deinstitutionalisation and primary health care.  Prior to 1997, mental health care in South Africa was mainly institutionalised, and little emphasis was placed on the development of curative therapies.  Due to a paucity of resources, it was more cost effective to simply isolate mentally unstable individuals rather than invest in effective, yet costly care.  Following the 1997 White Paper Act and the National Health Act 61 of 2003, the government made an attempt to deinstitutionalize mental health care and transfer the bulk of this responsibility to the level of Primary Health Care (PHC).    General category psychopharmacological drugs, which had previously only been available at mental institutions, are now present with 96% availability at primary health care facilities.  However, it was found in a study conducted by the World Health Organization that approximately 56% of mental health care still takes place in an institutionalised setting.  In the country of South Africa, there are only 290 registered psychiatrists, providing a physician to population ratio of 1:183,000.  With PHC facilities, there are only 0.04 psychiatrists per in-patient bed.    Primary health care facilities are so severely understaffed that a physician often does not have time to do anything other than refer a mental case to the district hospital.  In addition, less serious cases such as depression are often overlooked and rarely diagnosed. \nDoctors need to prioritise their work and spending time on a mood disorder case is seen as an ineffective use of their time.   There is also a lack of communication between primary health care facilities and district hospitals.  PHC physicians often refer mental cases to the district hospital, but rarely hear feedback on the case.  Since the primary care physician never learns about the new diagnoses or changes in treatment, he is unable to provide adequate follow-up care.  Not only does this break the continuity of care, but it also obstructs physicians from learning about these mental disorders and the appropriate treatments necessitated for different sets of symptoms.  This severely restricts any potential for a more autonomous primary care division.   Section::::Lack of official health policy.   The quality of mental health care varies greatly from district to district.  For instance, general psychotropic medications such as anti-psychotics and anti-epileptics are present with 81–100% availability in 4 provinces, 21–50% in 1 province, and 0% in another province.  The South African government has yet to institute a set of firm health protocols.  The policies outlined in the 1997 \"National Health Policy Guidelines for Improved Mental Health in South Africa\" were supposed to be the official health policy document. \nHowever, in interviews conducted between WHO representatives and South African Department of Health officials, it was found that more recently instituted policies contradicted statutes set out in the National Health Policy bill. Therefore, since adherence to this bill is virtually nonexistent, South Africa does not really possess a national health policy.    In order for the Department of Health to create an effective health policy, it first needs to establish standards for data collection and indicators to be applied to statistical analysis.  Although protocols regarding data collection and reporting exist, the sheer lack of personnel among PHC facilities makes such requirements impractical.  Only 75% of PHC mental facilities transmit some sort of statistical data to the health department, and much of this data is often incomplete and far from rigorous.   Section::::Additional problems.   In a study conducted in 2009 it was found that of the 16.5% of people suffering from mental disorders, only 25% had received treatment.  It has been found that the very factors that contribute to this high prevalence of mental illness also serve to inhibit its treatment.  Communicable disease, civil strife, and poverty run rife throughout South African society.  However, faced with limited resources, the South African government must prioritise its problems, and mental illness does not often take precedence. \nAs a result, many mental health facilities remain both severely understaffed and underfunded.   An additional problem resides in the high turnover among hospital staff.  The unique nature of psychiatric illness necessitates a certain degree of experience before effective treatment can be rendered.  However, many nurses leave before they are fully trained.  This is largely due to the lack of oversight from mental health specialists as many nurses stationed at the primary care facilities have little to no interaction with them.  As a result, this lack of direction results in the nurses becoming overwhelmed and eventually many will burn out and transfer.  Any progress made in the training of these nurses will be lost and the training process must be started again.    Additionally, the psychiatric nurses in the district hospitals lack specialisation.  Due to staff shortages, it is necessary to rotate nurses through all areas of the hospital.  As a result, the nurses caring for the psych patients have varying degrees of experience and many possess minimal familiarity with mental illness.   Another problem is the lack of intermediate care once a patient is released from the hospital.  Services such as support groups, special housing, and supported employment are virtually nonexistent in South Africa.  The Mental Health Care Act of 2002 states that follow-up care should be provided for chronic cases within available resources. \nHowever, due to the lack of resources, this intermediate care is never provided. Once treatment at a mental health facility is completed, the patient is handed back into the care of his fellow villagers and they are informed of the discharge instructions.  However, a lack of adherence to these instructions results in many patients regressing after being released.   Section::::Origins of mental health issues in South Africa.   Many factors including work-related stress, disease, poverty, abuse, sexual violence, as well as the decay of the traditional value system are contributing to the high occurrence of mental health issues in South Africa.  In a study conducted by the Mental Health and Poverty research Program, it was found that approximately 16.5% of the adult population in South Africa suffers from mental illness, with 1% suffering from a severe life debilitating mental disease.  30% of South Africans are likely to suffer a mental illness in their lifetimes, depression being the most common ailment.   However, these statistics may be an underestimation.  Among the native population, many still hold to the traditional belief that mental illness results from a demonic possession.  As a result, many individuals for fear of social ostracism, keep their mental illness secret instead of seeking the much needed medical attention. \nThis means that there is still a significant population suffering from mental illness that is currently unrepresented in mental health statistics.   Section::::Origins of mental health issues in South Africa.:Post-traumatic stress disorder.   Probably one of the largest contributors to the high frequency of mental disorders is violence.  Of the adult population ages 16 to 64, it was found that 23% were exposed to a traumatic event of violence in the past year.  These traumatic events include acts such as fighting a war, being tortured, or participating in violence.  Among this population, it was determined that mental illness including symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 8.5 times more prevalent than among the general population.   Section::::Origins of mental health issues in South Africa.:Substance abuse.   Another factor contributing to mental illness in South Africa is substance abuse.  Many provinces are used as drug trafficking routes, and as the South African government lacks the necessary resources to control this problem, many of these illicit drugs find their way into local populations as a drug.  In addition, the availability of the wild growing \"Cannabis\" plant allows for its rampant abuse among all age categories.  It was found that 52% of street children smoke the Cannabis plant and 22% on a daily basis. \nEducational campaigns are limited, and as a result, many do not realise the impinging health effects that will result from substance abuse.   Section::::Origins of mental health issues in South Africa.:Disease as a trigger.   Diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and HIV provide a significant contribution to the prevalence of mental illness.  Some of these diseases such as cerebral malaria can bear a direct physiological effect on the mental functionality of the patient.  However, even more poignant is the ability of disease to strike a radiating blow to the patient's emotional psyche.  For instance, the prevalence of mental illness among those suffering from HIV is 43.7% compared to the 16.5% observed among the general population.  This data indicates that disease delivers equal emotional damage as it does physiological harm.   Section::::Origins of mental health issues in South Africa.:Exposure to Western cultural pressures.   Both growth of the industrial sector and rapid urbanisation are undermining the social fabric of traditional society.  The alluring financial and social prospects of an urban environment draw many young individuals splitting up families and villages.  The family network which was once regarded as the emotional, moral, and social centre of the community is now being undermined. \n  As a result, many who are drawn to the city lose touch with their traditional roots and begin to lose a sense of purpose and direction as the focus is turned to utilitarian and hedonistic endeavours. In addition, they no longer have the invaluable social support structure that was once provided by family networks and village communities.   Section::::The role of African traditional medicine.   African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society.  It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem.  Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists.  Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness.  Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge.    In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine.  Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis.  Dr. Elmasri found that \"traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures\". \n  Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. Dr. Elmasri also recounts how he occasionally refers mild stress cases to the healers as these patients require a holistic approach from individuals that they know and trust.  The Traditional Health Practitioners Bill in South Africa, No. 25 of 2004 made attempts for the \"formalization, regulation and professionalization\" of traditional medicine doctors.  However, this bill has never been put into effect and formal collaboration between Western and traditional medicine has yet to be established.   The Westernised approach to treating mental illness often ends up worsening the patient's condition.  In a three decade long study conducted by the World Health Organization which includes data from 30 research sites in 19 countries, it was found that people diagnosed with schizophrenia experienced better outcomes among \"developing\" countries than they did in Europe and the United States.  Much of this trend is attributed to socio-cultural conditions such as \"increased family involvement, informal economies, less segregation of the mentally ill and community cohesion\".    Effective treatment of mental illness necessitates the recognition and identification of cultural differences.  For example, in Western society, many derive a sense of self-worth from their ability to survive in a competitive economy. \nHowever, the informal economies of the developing nations allow for less stressful work-related roles. Therefore, conducting therapy in South Africa with an emphasis on \"valued citizenship\" does nothing more than create an intangible goal which will simply cause added stress to the individual.  Effective treatment must be uniquely targeted to each culture with careful consideration to the socio-cultural conditions and \"contextually relevant coping mechanisms\".  Neglect to recognise these essential cultural factors will result with impotent and detrimental treatment.   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_6447281","text":" Oat milk  Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients.  Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate.  Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s.   Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute.  Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).   Section::::History.   Section::::History.:Creation.   Soy milk predates all other alternative milks, including oat milk, both as a cultural and commercial product.  Within the past hundred years, soy milk made its way from Asia to European and American grocery stores, initially as a dairy substitute due to lactose intolerance. \nThe increase in consumption of soy milk since its global distribution created a large market for plant-based, non-dairy milks like oat milk.  Oats have traditionally been grown as a minor cereal crop for animal feed, but have more recently been used in the production of functional foods, due to their high nutrient density and known beneficial health effects.  The first example of an oat-based plant beverage was in the early 1990s, when Rickard Oste developed oat milk.  Oste was working as a food scientist at Lund University in Lund, Sweden, researching lactose intolerance and sustainable food systems, when he invented the drink.  Soon after, Oste founded Oatly, the first commercial manufacturer of oat milk.   Section::::History.:Market expansion.   The pioneer in commercial oat milk, Oatly, now has its products in over 2,200 coffee shops and 1,000 grocery stores across the United States, but is not the only prominent oat milk producer.  Oat milk can be found under brand names Oatly (Sweden), Pureharvest (Australia), Alpro (UK), Bioavena (Italy), Simpli (Finland), Vitasoy (Hong Kong), and Pacific (USA), among others.  In the United States, Blue Crate Oat Milk distributes across the east coast. \n  The large market expansion was officially recognized by the United Kingdom in March of 2017 when \"non-dairy milk drinks\" were added to the Office for National Statistics' inflation basket for the first time. Another indication of oat milk's rise in popularity is the 2018 decision of PepsiCo (a company ranked #102 on Forbes' 2018 Global 2000 List of the World's Largest Public Companies) to develop an oat drink of its own, \"Quaker Oat Beverage,\" under the Quaker Oats brand.    There have been numerous occasions of oat milk shortage from unprecedented demand in Europe and North America, highlighting the high level of consumer demand for this product.   Section::::Production.   Section::::Production.:Process.  The production of oat milk is similar to that of most other plant milks.  Cereal grains like oats are indigestible when unprocessed due to their hard, outer hull, so processing is necessary to create a product with nutrients which are bioavailable.  The procedure starts by grinding, or milling, oats to break apart their outer hull.    Soaking and subsequently extracting nutrients from the oats have the most direct implications on the final milk product. \nIncreasing the yield in this step may be assisted by chemical catalysts, enzymes, or an increase in temperature, all in order to remove nutrient molecules from the solid byproduct and incorporate them into the liquid. Chemical catalysts increase the pH of the mixture, enzymatic catalysts induce partial hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides, and higher temperatures increase reaction rates.  Separating the liquid from the solid byproduct is a simple step achieved through filtration, decanting, or centrifugation.    Once the liquid product is isolated, adding other ingredients, such as fortifying vitamins and minerals, or sweeteners, flavorings, salts, oils, and similar, formulates the final product.  Oat milk is naturally lower in calcium, iron, and vitamin A than dairy milk, so the addition of these nutrients is necessary in order for the product to be a direct nutritional substitute of dairy milk.  Homogenization and heat-treatments such as pasteurization or ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatments are used to extend the product's shelf life.   Section::::Production.:Challenges to processing.   Because oat milk is produced by the disintegration of plant materials, the resulting particle sizes are not as uniform as bovine milk.  This variation in particle size is due to the vastly different lipid and protein molecules. \nDecreasing particle size, improving particle solubility, and using hydrocolloids and emulsifiers are common ways to improve product quality via homogenization.  Another problem posed by the natural composition of oats is their high starch content.  The starch content (50-60%) is challenging during UHT treatments because of starch's relatively low gelatinization temperature.  To overcome this, producers use an enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by alpha- and beta-amylase, producing maltodextrins which gelatinize at higher, more suitable temperatures.   Adding ingredients as fortifying nutrients is also a difficult procedure.  The nutrients must be bioavailable and stable in the final product, otherwise the quality or effectiveness of the product may be insufficient.  Research is often funded to discover procedures which successfully incorporate bioavailable nutrients into oat and other plant-based milks.   Section::::Uses.   Oat milk is highly applicable for diets of individuals who suffer from lactose intolerance (LI), cow's milk allergy (CMA), celiac disease (CD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), radioiodine cancer treatment, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and possibly other conditions which cause poor reactions to dairy. \nThe worldwide prevalence of lactose intolerance is 75%, and while not all individuals affected by LI may be potential customers for oat milk, the pervasiveness of LI provides a strong future outlook. Oat milk is a recommended dairy milk substitute for individuals who suffer from IBS and IBD as part of the Anti-Inflammatory Diet (AID), thus IBS and IBD patients report a much higher intake of oat milk than other demographics.   Use of oat milk in one's diet can also be a lifestyle choice, independent of medical dietary restrictions.  Consumers may opt to buy oat milk for its more environmentally sustainable footprint, compared to dairy milk, or in protest of the inhumane treatment of animals in dairy productions.   Multiple studies have found that oat milk is also viable substitute for dairy milk in producing fermented milk products such as yogurts, kefir, prebiotics, and probiotics, retaining its characteristic nutrient content.

{"id":"KILT_6453717","text":" Air source heat pumps  An air source heat pump (ASHP) is a system which transfers heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa.  Under the principles of vapor compression refrigeration, an ASHP uses a refrigerant system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another.  They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called \"reverse-cycle air conditioners\".   In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply.  The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house.  When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80 °C.   Section::::Description.   Air at any temperature above absolute zero contains some energy.  An air-source heat pump transfers ('pumps') some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building.  This can provide space heating and/or hot water. \nA single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating.   The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components.  Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.   The main components of an air-source heat pump are:  BULLET::::- An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air  BULLET::::- An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or underfloor circuits and/or a domestic hot water tank  Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating.  A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy.  In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an air source heat pump may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). \nUse of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.  A \"standard\" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about .  At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough.  There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.   Section::::In cold climates.   An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold −30 °C (−22 °F).  Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.  One Mitsubishi model provides heat at −35 °C, but the Coefficient of performance (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature.  At −30 °C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data, although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to −30 °C. \nAlthough air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed ground source heat pumps in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice. A study by Natural Resources Canada found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in Ottawa, Ontario in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP.  (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below −30 °C.  The record low for Ottawa is −36 °C.)  The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas, when considering only energy efficiency in the home.  When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories (Alberta, Nova Scotia, and the Northwest Territories) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation.  (The energy savings in Saskatchewan were marginal.  Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) \nDespite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of Quebec, which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.)  The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system.  However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil.  The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil.  The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating.  Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP.  (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil.  Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) \nThe report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles.  Section::::Longevity.   Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.  There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold.  Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements.  However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris.  Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.  Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors.  The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years.   Section::::Usage.   Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates.  A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. \nThough the cost of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a \"ground source\" heat pump, because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.   ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions.  Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected.  Propane, natural gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.   All-electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up.  A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home.  This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. \nElectrical service outages pose the same threat as to central forced-air systems and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric fireplace inserts can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to solar panels as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.   Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs.  Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are available.  Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure.  ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating.  Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.   The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is between 0 °C and 5 °C (32 °F to 41 °F).  This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil.  These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. \nThis requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate. The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.   It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat.  The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature underfloor heating system be installed instead.  Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained.   Section::::Technology.   Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a refrigerant through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils.  Like in a refrigerator, a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder liquid and hotter gas states.   When the liquid refrigerant at a low temperature and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or vapor): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as latent heat. \nThe gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas.  Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure valve into heat exchanger coils.  There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored latent heat to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system.  The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or fan.   The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle.   Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.   Section::::Efficiency ratings.   The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the Coefficient of performance (COP).  A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes.  Within temperature ranges of −3 °C to 10 °C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3–3.5.   In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4.  However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day. \nThe heat pump's performance is limited by the Carnot cycle and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18 °C / 0 °F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to −20 °C, pushing the break-even figure downward to −30 °C (−22 °F).  A ground source heat pump has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.   The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency.  Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as air conditioning units, mainly for use in summer temperatures.  Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP ratings and an extended life cycle.  The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator.   Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) and seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) respectively. \n In units charged with HFC refrigerants, the COP rating is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60 °C or to heat conventional central heating systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).  Section::::Risks and precautions.   BULLET::::- Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit).  CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as −30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps.  If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.   BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired.  In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures.   Section::::Controversy. \n Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant.   Section::::Impact on electric utilities.   While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement.  Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities.  The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. \nA study in Canada's Yukon Territory, where diesel generators are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost effective heating alternative for Yukon residents.  As wind farms are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from wind turbines and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

{"id":"KILT_4104862","text":" Hemileia vastatrix  Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations.  Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (\"Coffea sp.\") in order to survive.  There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust.    Section::::Appearance.   The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter.  Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter.  Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced.   Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline. \n Urediniospores are more or less reniform, 26–40 × 18-28 µm, with hyaline to pale yellowish wall, 1–2 µm thick, strongly warted on the convex side, smooth on the straight or concave side, warts frequently longer (3–7 µm) on spore edges.  Spermogonia and aecia are unknown.   Section::::Lifecycle.   \"Hemileia\" lifecycle begins with the germination of uredospores through germ pores in the spore.  It mainly attacks the leaves and is only rarely found on young stems and fruit.  Appressoria are produced, which in turn produce vesicles, from which entry into the substomatal cavity is gained.  Within 24–48 hours, infection is completed.  After successful infection, the leaf blade is colonized and sporulation will occur through the stomata.  One lesion produces 4–6 spore crops over a 3–5 month period releasing 300–400,000 spores.   While the predominant hypothesis is that \"H. vastatrix\" is heteroecious, completing its life cycle on an alternate host plant which has not yet been found, an alternative hypothesis is that \"H. vastatrix\" actually represents an early-diverging autoecious rust, in which the teliospores are non-functional and vestigial, and the sexual life cycle is completed by the urediniospores.  Hidden meiosis and sexual reproduction (cryptosexuality) has been found within the generally asexual urediniospores. \nThis finding may explain why new physiological races have arisen so often and so quickly in \"H. vastatrix.\"  Section::::Ecology.   \"Hemileia vastatrix\" is an obligate parasite that lives mainly on the plants of genus \"Coffea\", reportedly also on \"Gardenia\" in South Africa.   It needs suitable temperatures to develop (not less than 10 °C and not greater than 35 °C).  The presence of free water is required for infection to be completed.  Loss of moisture after germination starts inhibits the whole infection process.   Sporulation is most influenced by temperature, humidity, and host resistance.  The colonization process is not dependent on leaf wetness but is influenced greatly by temperature and by plant resistance.  The main effect of temperature is to determine the length of time for the colonization process (incubation period).   \"Hemileia vastatrix\" has two fungal parasites, \"Verticillium haemiliae\" and \"Verticillium psalliotae\".   The fungus is of East African origin, but nowadays widely spread in Africa, tropical Asia, and Central and South America.  Coffee originates from high altitude regions of Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya and the rust pathogen is believed to have originated from the same mountains.  The earliest reports of the disease hail from the 1860s. \nIt was reported first by a British explorer from regions of Kenya around Lake Victoria in 1861 from where it is believed to have spread to Asia and the Americas.  Rust was first reported in the major coffee growing regions of Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in 1867.  The causal fungus was first fully described by the English mycologist Michael Joseph Berkeley and his collaborator Christopher Edmund Broome after an analysis of specimens of a “coffee leaf disease” collected by George H.K. Thwaites in Ceylon.  Berkeley and Broome named the fungus \"Hemileia vastatrix\", \"\"Hemileia\"\" referring to the half smooth characteristic of the spores and \"\"vastatrix\"\" for the devastating nature of the disease.   It is unknown exactly how the rust reached Ceylon from Ethiopia.  Over the years that followed, the disease was recorded in India in 1870, Sumatra in 1876, Java in 1878, and the Philippines in 1889.  During 1913 it crossed the African continent from Kenya to the Congo, where it was found in 1918, before spreading to West Africa, the Ivory Coast (1954), Liberia (1955), Nigeria (1962–63) and Angola (1966).   Uredospores are disseminated across long distances mainly by wind, and over short distances by both wind and rain. \nOther agents such as animals, mainly insects and man, occasionally have been shown to be involved with dissemination.  Section::::History.   The disease was first described and named by Berkley and Broom in the November 1869 edition of the \"Gardeners Chronicle\".  They used specimens sent from Sri Lanka, where the disease was already causing enormous damage to productivity.  Many coffee estates in Sri Lanka were forced to collapse or convert their crops to alternatives not affected by CLR, such as tea.  The planters nicknamed the disease \"Devastating Emily\" and it affected Asian coffee production for over twenty years.  By 1890 the coffee industry in Sri Lanka was nearly destroyed, although coffee estates still exist in some areas.  Historians suggest that the devastated coffee production in Sri Lanka is one of the reasons why Britons have come to prefer tea, as Sri Lanka switched to tea production as a consequence of the disease.   By the 1920s CLR was widely found across much of Africa and Asia, as well as Indonesia and Fiji.  It reached Brazil in 1970 and from there it rapidly spread at a rate enabling it to infect all coffee areas in the country by 1975.  From Brazil, the disease spread to most coffee-growing areas in Central and South America by 1981, hitting Costa Rica and Colombia in 1983. \n As of 1990, coffee rust has become endemic in all major coffee-producing countries.  Section::::History.:2012 coffee leaf rust epidemic.   In 2012, there was a major increase in coffee rust across ten Latin American and Caribbean countries.  The disease became an epidemic and the resulting crop losses led to a fall in supply, outstripping demand.  Coffee prices rose as a result, although other factors such as growing demand for gourmet beans in China, Brazil and India also contributed.   The reasons for the epidemic remain unclear but an emergency rust summit meeting in Guatemala in April 2013 compiled a long list of shortcomings.  These included a lack of resources to control the rust, the dismissal of early warning signs, ineffective fungicide application techniques, lack of training, poor infrastructure and conflicting advice.  In a keynote talk at the “Let’s Talk Roya” meeting (El Salvador, November 4, 2013), Dr Peter Baker, a senior scientist at CAB International, raised several key points regarding the epidemic including the proportional lack of investment in research and development in such a high value industry and the lack of investment in new varieties in key coffee producing countries such as Colombia.   Section::::Economic Impact.   Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) has direct and indirect economic impacts on coffee production. \nDirect impacts include decreased quantity and quality of yield produced by the diseased plant. Indirect impacts include increased costs to combat and control the disease.  Methods of combating and controlling the disease include fungicide application and stumping diseased plants and replacing them with resistant breeds.  Both methods include significant labor and material costs and in the case of stumping, include a years-long decline in production (coffee seedlings are not fully productive for three to five years after planting).   Due to the complexity of accurately accounting for losses attributed to CLR, there are few records quantifying yield losses.  Estimates of yield loss vary by country and can range anywhere between 15-80%.  Worldwide loss is estimated at 15%.   Some early data from Ceylon documenting the losses in the late 19th century indicate coffee production was reduced by 75%.  As farmers shifted from coffee to other crops not affected by CLR, land used for growing coffee was reduced by 80%, from 68,787 to 14,170 ha.   In addition to the costs mentioned above, additional costs include research and development costs in producing resistant cultivars.  These costs are normally borne by the industry, local and national governments and international aid agencies. \n Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers (Fedecafe) set up a research lab specifically designed to find ways to stop the disease, as the country is a leading exporter of the \"Coffea arabica\" bean that is particularly prone to the disease.  Section::::Disease reports.   Coffee crops in Guatemala have been ruined by coffee rust, and a state of emergency has been declared in February 2013.   CLR has been a problem in Mexico.   CLR disease is a big problem in coffee plantations in Peru, declared in sanitary emergency by government (Decreto Supremo N° 082-2013-PCM).   Section::::References.

In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide - to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.

{"id":"KILT_28678189-1","text":" Akwa Akpa  Akwa Akpa, known to European colonists as Old Calabar or Duke Town, was an Efik city-state that flourished in the 19th century in what is now southern Nigeria.  Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized.  The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar.   Section::::Origins and society.   The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger–Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.  One tradition says that Abasi's wife Atai persuaded him to let two of their children, a daughter and son, settle on the earth.  They were not allowed to breed, but disobeyed this injunction and became the ancestors of the Efik people.

{"id":"KILT_28678189-2","text":"Another version says that Abasi created two people, and did not allow them to breed. When they disobeyed this order, in punishment Abasi let loose death on the earth.   The religion places importance on paying tribute to the village ancestors, particularly those who achieved high rank, since they can affect the fortunes of the living for good or bad.  The earth deity Ala is appeased through the Ogbom ceremony, which makes children plentiful and increases the harvest.   Some Efik belong to the Ekpe secret society.  They made detailed wood carvings, masks, and accouterments that are considered complex works of art.  Efik sacred ceremonies include drumming and music as important elements.   Section::::Slave trade.   The coast in this region was named \"Calabar\" by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cao.   His reason for choosing this name is unknown, since it was not used by the Efik people.   The city of Akwa Akpa was founded by Efik families who had left Creek Town, further up the Calabar river, settling on the east bank in a position where they were able to dominate the slave trade with European vessels that anchored in the river.  They soon became the most powerful people in the region. ","title":"Akwa Akpa","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akwa%20Akpa&oldid=860668126"}
{"id":"KILT_28678189-3","text":" Akwa Akpa, also known as Duke Town to the British, became a center of the slave trade, where slaves were exchanged for European goods.  The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area.   Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.  By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.  They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.   Section::::Later history.   The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.

{"id":"KILT_26451793","text":" Traditional African medicine  Traditional African medicine is a traditional medicine discipline involving indigenous herbalism and African spirituality, typically involving diviners, midwives, and herbalists.  Practitioners of traditional African medicine claim to be able to cure various and diverse conditions such as cancers, psychiatric disorders, high blood pressure, cholera, most venereal diseases, epilepsy, asthma, eczema, fever, anxiety, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract infections, gout, and healing of wounds and burns and even Ebola.   Diagnosis is reached through spiritual means and a treatment is prescribed, usually consisting of a herbal remedy that is considered to have not only healing abilities but also symbolic and spiritual significance.  Traditional African medicine, with its belief that illness is not derived from chance occurrences, but through spiritual or social imbalance, differs greatly from modern scientific medicine, which is technically and analytically based.  In the 21st century, modern pharmaceuticals and medical procedures remain inaccessible to large numbers of African people due to their relatively high cost and concentration of health facilities in urban centres.   Before the establishment of science-based medicine, traditional medicine was the dominant medical system for millions of people in Africa but the arrival of the Europeans was a noticeable turning point in the history of this ancient tradition and culture. \nHerbal medicines in Africa are generally not adequately researched, and are weakly regulated. There is a lack of the detailed documentation of the traditional knowledge, which is generally transferred orally.  Serious adverse effects can result from mis-identification or misuse of healing plants.   The geographical reach of this article is sub-saharan Africa.  Though, of course neighbouring medical traditions influenced traditional \"African medicine\".   Section::::History.   Section::::History.:Colonial era.   Science has, in the past, considered methods of traditional knowledge as primitive and backward.  Under colonial rule, traditional diviner-healers were outlawed because they were considered by many nations to be practitioners of witchcraft and magic, and declared illegal by the colonial authorities, creating a war against aspects of the indigenous culture that were seen as witchcraft.  During this time, attempts were also made to control the sale of herbal medicines.  After Mozambique obtained independence in 1975, attempts to control traditional medicine went as far as sending diviner-healers to re-education camps.  As colonialism and Christianity spread through Africa, colonialists built general hospitals and Christian missionaries built private ones, with the hopes of making headway against widespread diseases. \nLittle was done to investigate the legitimacy of these practices, as many foreigners believed that the native medical practices were pagan and superstitious and could only be suitably fixed by inheriting Western methods according to Onwuanibe. During times of conflict, opposition has been particularly vehement as people are more likely to call on the supernatural realm.  Consequently, doctors and health practitioners have, in most cases, continued to shun traditional practitioners despite their contribution to meeting the basic health needs of the population.   Section::::History.:Modern period.   In recent years, the treatments and remedies used in traditional African medicine have gained more appreciation from researchers in science.  Developing countries have begun to realize the high costs of modern health care systems and the technologies that are required, thus proving Africa's dependence to it.  Due to this, interest has recently been expressed in integrating traditional African medicine into the continent's national health care systems.  An African healer embraced this concept by making a 48-bed hospital, the first of its kind, in Kwa-Mhlanga, South Africa, which combines traditional methods with homeopathy, iridology, and other Western healing methods, even including some traditional Asian medicine. \nHowever, the highly sophisticated technology involved in modern medicine, which is beginning to integrate into Africa's health care system, could possibly destroy Africa's deep-seated cultural values.  Section::::Diagnostics.   The diagnoses and chosen methods of treatment in traditional African medicine rely heavily on spiritual aspects, often based on the belief that psycho-spiritual aspects should be addressed before medical aspects.  In African culture, it is believed that \"nobody becomes sick without sufficient reason.\"  Traditional practitioners look at the ultimate \"who\" rather than the \"what\" when locating the cause and cure of an illness, and the answers given come from the cosmological beliefs of the people.  Rather than looking to the medical or physical reasons behind an illness, traditional healers attempt to determine the root cause underlying it, which is believed to stem from a lack of balance between the patient and their social environment or the spiritual world, not by natural causes.  Natural causes are, in fact, not seen as natural at all, but manipulations of spirits or the gods.  For example, sickness is sometimes said to be attributed to guilt by the person, family, or village for a sin or moral infringement. \nThe illness, therefore, would stem from the displeasure of the gods or God, due to an infraction of universal moral law. According to the type of imbalance the individual is experiencing, an appropriate healing plant will be used, which is valued for its symbolic and spiritual significance as well as for its medicinal effect.   When a person falls ill, a traditional practitioner uses incantations to make a diagnosis.  Incantations are thought to give the air of mystical and cosmic connections.  Divination is typically used if the illness is not easily identified, otherwise, the sickness may be quickly diagnosed and given a remedy.  If divination is required, then the practitioner will advise the patient to consult a diviner who can further give a diagnosis and cure.  Contact with the spirit world through divination often requires not only medication, but sacrifices.   Section::::Treatments.   Traditional practitioners use a wide variety of treatments ranging from \"magic\" to biomedical methods such as fasting and dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, and surgical procedures.  Migraines, coughs, abscesses, and pleurisy are often treated using the method of \"bleed-cupping\" after which an herbal ointment is applied with follow-up herbal drugs.  Animals are also sometimes used to transfer the illness to afterward or for the manufacture of medicines for zootherapy. \nSome cultures also rub hot herbal ointment across the patient's eyelids to cure headaches. Malaria is treated by both drinking and using the steam from an herbal mixture.  Fevers are often treated using a steam bath.  Also, vomiting is induced, or emetics, in an attempt to cure some diseases.  For example, raw beef is soaked in the drink of an alcoholic person to induce vomiting and nausea and treat alcoholism.  In the Bight of Benin, the natives have been known to use the fat of a boa constrictor to allegedly cure gout and rheumatism, and it also is thought to relieve chest pain when rubbed into the skin.  Within South Africa some examples of zootherapy are the utilization of the bones of baboons as a treatment for arthritis, or the rubbing of the terpenoids of the blister beetle (Mylabris sp.) into the skin as a treatment for skin diseases.  Approximately 60%-80% of the people in Africa rely on traditional remedies to treat themselves for various diseases.  A recent systematic review estimated that close to 60% (58.2%)[4.6%-94%] of the general population in sub-Saharan Africa use traditional and complementary medicine product. \nA large percentage of the people in South Africa also rely on traditional remedies to treat their animals for various diseases.Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone have recently been reported to using traditional and complementary medicine alone or together with conventional medicine   Section::::Treatments.:Medicinal plants.  Africa is endowed with many plants that can be used for medicinal purposes to which they have taken full advantage.  In fact, out of the approximated 6400 plant species used in tropical Africa, more than 4000 are used as medicinal plants.  Medicinal plants are used in the treatments of many diseases and illnesses, the uses and effects of which are of growing interest to Western societies.  Not only are plants used and chosen for their healing abilities, but they also often have symbolic and spiritual significance.  For example, leaves, seeds, and twigs that are white, black and red are seen as especially symbolic or magical and possess special properties.   Examples of some medicinal plants include:  BULLET::::- Pygeum (\"Prunus africana\"): Pygeum is not only used in traditional African medicine, but has developed a following around the world, as a cure for mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia, claimed by its users to increase the ease of urination and reduce inflammation and cholesterol deposits. \nIn traditional African practice, the bark is made into tea, whereas elsewhere in the world it is found in powders, tinctures, and pills. Pygeum has been sold in Europe since the 1970's and is harvested in mass quantities in Cameroon and Madagascar each year.   BULLET::::- Securidaca longipedunculata: This is a tropical plant found almost everywhere across the continent with different uses in every part of Africa.  In Tanzania, the dried bark and root are used as a laxative for nervous system disorders, with one cup of the mixture being taken daily for two weeks.  In East Africa, dried leaves from the plant are used in the treatment of wounds and sores, coughs, venereal diseases, and snakebites.  In Malawi, the leaves are also used for wounds, coughs, venereal diseases, and snakebites, as well as bilharzia, and the dried leaves are used to cure headaches.  In other parts of the continent, parts of the plant are used to cure skin diseases, malaria, impotence, epilepsy, and are also used as an aphrodisiac. \n A study, entitled \"ACE Inhibitor Activity of Nutritive Plants in Kwa-Zulu Natal\", was conducted by Irene Mackraj and S. Ramesar, both of the Department of Physiology and Physiological Chemistry; and H. Baijnath, Department of Biological and Conservation Sciences; University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa to examine the effectiveness of 16 plants growing in Africa's KwaZulu-Natal region, concluding that eight plant extracts may hold value for treating high blood pressure (hypertension). The plants (known locally as muti) used by traditional healers that the team examined were:  Of the 16 plants, \"Amaranthus dubius\", \"Amaranthus hybridus\", \"Asystasia gangetica\", \"Galinsoga parviflora\", \"Justicia flava\", \"Oxygonum sinuatum\", \"Physalis viscosa\", and \"Tulbaghia violacea\" were found to have some positive effects, with the latter proving to be the most promising with the ability to lower one's blood pressure.  The unique infrageneric diversity of \"Aloe L.\" (\"Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae\") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent.  Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. \n Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative.  \"Cannabis sativa\" (intsango).  The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam.  In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension.   \"Carduus tenuiflorus\" (uMhlakavuthwa).  The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person.  It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself.   \"Datura stramonium\" (uQhwangu-qhwangu).  Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling.  It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision.  With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency.  The fresh leaves are also applied on boils twice a day.    \"Emex australis\" (inkunzane).  This root is used on infants suffering from restlessness or constipation.  It is used as a root decoction.  Adults also use the decoction to treat constipation.    \"Galenia secunda\".  It is used to treat kidney pains in adults. \nThe root is mixed with the roots of emex australis (inkunzane). Two teaspoons of the decoction are taken twice a day.  It is also administered to babies with colic using two drops a day.   \"Lantana camara\" (iqunule).  It is used to treat back/ abdominal pains.  The roots are boiled in water and drunk as tea twice a day.  Also, it is used to treat gonococcal infection and urinary problems caused by sexual intercourse.    \"Opuntia ficus-indica\" (itolofiya).  It is used to treat sores between toes and the fingers, these sores are caused by igazi elimdaka (dirty blood).  These toes tend to become swollen and ooze pus.  The fresh leaf is baked in an open fire, the inner jelly is then used to apply on the sores.   \"Rumex sagittatus\" (ibhathatha.  The root infusion is put in cold water and used as a body wash.  It is used to cleanse the body of misfortunes and evil.    \"Schinus molle\" (ipepile).  The leaf decoction is taken orally to treat fever and influenza.  The leaves are added to boiling water and the steam used to treat fever.    \"Anredera cordifolia\" (idlula). \nThe plants' leaves are crushed and applied on swollen feet whose cause is attributed to poor blood circulation. It is also used to treat kidney or liver problems.  The leaves' sap is then used to treat the rash that is caused by one's contact with dirty water.   \"Araucaria bidwillii\" (indiyandyiya).  This is used to treat amenorrhea caused by congenital problems, tuberculosis and malnutrition.  The bark is grated and one tablespoon of the remains is mixed with 750ml of cold water.  The mixture is taken orally once a day.   \"Araujia sericifera\" (iquwa).  It is used to treat amafufunyana, amafufunyana is described is described by Ngubane as an extreme form of depression coupled with psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hysteria, violent outburst and suicide ideations.  The roots are mixed with other medications to treat amafufunyana.   \"Argemone mexicana\" (ikhakhakhakha).  This root decoction is mixed with the roots of the rubus pinnatus (iqunube).  It is administered through the use of an enema to cure kidney pain.  The mixture should be used immediately as if left to stand for long it becomes harmful.   \"Bidens pilosa\" (umhlabangubo).  It is used to treat infertility in women.  The roots are cleaned, boiled in   water then taken orally. \nAlso, it is used to wash one's body after the leaves have been soaked overnight in the bathing water. Thus bathing water is believed to protect one from evil spirits (imoya emdaka).   Section::::Treatments.:Medicinal plants.:Recent discoveries.   BULLET::::- Other plants scientifically studied in 2016 include \"Erigeron floribundus\", a medicinal plant used in Cameroon, inhibited \"Staphylococcus aureus\" nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NadD) yet had no effect the human analogue.  Among the constituents of the essential oil are spathulenol and limonene.   BULLET::::- A traditional medicine from the tropical Olon tree, and another species of genus \"Zanthoxylum\", was found to have synergistic compounds that kill both mosquitoes and their plasmodium parasites.   Section::::Treatments.:Spirituality.   Some healers may employ the use of charms, incantations, and the casting of spells in their treatments.  The dualistic nature of traditional African medicine between the body and soul, matter, and spirit and their interactions with one another are also seen as a form of magic.  Richard Onwuanibe gives one form of magic the name \"Extra-Sensory-Trojection.\"  This is the belief among the Ibos of Nigeria that medicine men can implant something into a person from a distance to inflict sickness on them.  This is referred to by the Ibos as\"egba ogwu.\" \nTo remove the malignant object, the intervention of a second medicine man is typically required, who then removes it by making an incision in the patient. \"Egba ogwu\" involves psychokinetic processes.  Another form of magic used by these practitioners, which is more widely known, is sympathetic magic, in which a model is made of the victim.  Actions performed on the model are transferred to the victim, in a manner similar to the familiar voodoo doll.  \"In cases where spirits of deceased relatives trouble the living and cause illness, medicine men prescribe remedies, often in the form of propitiatory sacrifice, in order to put them to rest so that they will no longer trouble the living, especially children.\"  Using charms and amulets to cure diseases and illnesses is an uncertain and clouded practice that requires more scientific investigation.   In African cultures, the act of healing is considered a religious act.  Therefore, the healing process often attempts to appeal to God because it is ultimately God who can not only inflict sickness, but provide a cure.  Africans have a religious world view which makes them aware of the feasibility of divine or spirit intervention in healing with many healers referring to the supreme god as the source of their medical power. \nFor example, the !Kung people of the Kalahari Desert believe that the great God Hishe created all things and, therefore, controls all sickness and death. Hishe, however, bestows mystical powers for curing sickness on certain men.  Hishe presents himself to these medicine men in dreams and hallucinations, giving them curative power.  Because this god is generous enough to give this power to the medicine men, they are expected to practice healing freely.  The !Kung medicine men effect a cure by performing a tribal dance.  Loma Marshall, who took expeditions to South West Africa with her family to study the !Kung people, writing two books on their findings, describes the ceremonial curing dance as follows:  At the dances not only may the sick be cured, but pending evil and misfortune averted.  The !Kung believe that the great god may send \"Gauwa\" or the \"gauwas\" at any time with ill for someone and that these beings may be lurking awaiting their chance to inflict it.  The medicine men in the dances combat them, drive them away, and protect the people.    Usually there are several medicine men performing at the same time.  To cure they go into trance, which varies in depth as the ceremony proceeds... \nWhen a man begins, he leaves the line of dancing men, and still singing, leans over the person he is going to cure, going eventually to every person present, even the infants. He places one hand on the person's chest, one on their back, and flutters his hands.  The !Kung believe that in this way he draws the sickness, real or potential, out of the person through his own arms into himself...  Finally, the medicine man throws up his arms to cast the sickness out, hurling it into the darkness back to \"Gauwa\" or the \"gauwasi\", who are there beyond the firelight, with a harp, yelping cry of \"Kai Kai Kai.\"   Loma Marshall does not give any information as to whether or not the dance is successful in curing the patient but says that it purges the people's emotions for their \"support and solace and hope.\"   Section::::Traditional medicinal practitioners.   Many traditional medicinal practitioners are people without education, who have rather received knowledge of medicinal plants and their effects on the human body from their forebears.  They have a deep and personal involvement in the healing process and protect the therapeutic knowledge by keeping it a secret. \n In a manner similar to orthodox medicinal practice, the practitioners of traditional medicine specialize in particular areas of their profession. Some, such as the inyangas of Swaziland are experts in herbalism, whilst others, such as the South African sangomas, are experts in spiritual healing as diviners, and others specialize in a combination of both forms of practice.  There are also traditional bone setters and birth attendants.  Herbalists are becoming more and more popular in Africa with an emerging herb trading market in Durban that is said to attract between 700,000 and 900,000 traders per year from South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.  Smaller trade markets exist in virtually every community.  Their knowledge of herbs has been invaluable in African communities and they were the only ones who could gather them in most societies.  Midwives also make extensive use of indigenous plants to aid childbirth.  African healers commonly \"describe and explain illness in terms of social interaction and act on the belief that religion permeates every aspect of human existence.\"   Section::::Traditional medicinal practitioners.:Payments.   Traditional healers, like any other profession, are rewarded for their services.  In African societies, the payment for a treatment depends on its efficacy.  They do not request payment until after the treatment is given. \nThis is another reason many prefer traditional healers to western doctors who require payment before the patient has assessed the effectiveness of the treatment. The payment methods have changed over time, with many practitioners now asking for monetary payment, especially in urban settings, rather than their receiving good in exchange, as happened formerly.   There are also a growing number of fraudulent practitioners who only interested in making money, especially in urban areas.   Section::::Traditional medicinal practitioners.:Learning the trade.   Some healers learn the trade through personal experience while being treated as a patient who decide to become healers upon recovery.  Others become traditional practitioners through a \"spiritual calling\" and, therefore, their diagnoses and treatments are decided through the supernatural.  In some cultures, a sign of calling can come from mental disarrangement said to be caused by \"agwu Nshi,\" the spirit of divining, through which the healer gains inspiration.  Through this training, psychological stability is eventually attained.  Another route is receive the knowledge and skills passed down informally from a close family member such as a father or uncle, or even a mother or aunt in the case of midwives.  Apprenticeship to an established practitioner, who formally teaches the trade over a long period of time and is paid for their tutoring, is another route to becoming a healer. \nThe training is complex, depending on the kind of medical practice that the aspiring practitioner wants to be a part of. Once the trainee is officially initiated as a healer, they are, in some societies, considered to be half-man and half spirit, possessing the power to mediate between the human and supernatural world to invoke spiritual power in their healing processes.   Section::::Traditional medicinal practitioners.:Importance.   In Africa, the importance of traditional healers and remedies made from indigenous plants play a crucial role in the health of millions.  According to the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), one estimate puts the number of Africans who routinely use these services for primary health care as high as 85% in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The relative ratios of traditional practitioners and university trained doctors in relation to the whole population in African countries showcases this importance.  For example, in Ghana, in Kwahu district, for every traditional practitioner there are 224 people, against one university trained doctor for nearly 21,000.  In Swaziland, the same situation applies, where for every healer there are 110 people whereas for every university trained doctor there are 10,000 people. \nAccording to Nairobi-based specialist in biodiversity and traditional medicine with the IDRC Francois Gasengayire, there is one healer for every 200 people in the Southern Africa region which is a much greater doctor-to-patient ratio than is found in North America.  Ratios of doctors (practicing modern medicine) and traditional medical practitioners to patients in east and southern Africa:  \"*TMP refers to Traditional Medical Practitioner\"  \"Note: References with an asterisk are in Cunningham, 1993.\"   This table showing the ratio of traditional medical practitioner to patient and Western practitioner to patient shows that in many parts of Africa, practitioners trained in modern medicine are few and far between.  Because of this, healers prove to be a large and influential group in primary health care and an integral part of the African culture and are required for the health of its people.  Without them, many people would go untreated.   Medications and treatments that Western pharmaceutical companies manufacture are far too costly and not available widely enough for most Africans.  Many rural African communities are not able to afford the high price of pharmaceuticals and can not readily obtain them even if they were affordable; therefore, healers are their only means of medical help. \nAccording to Sekagya Yahaya Hills, who is a university-trained dentist and a traditional healer in Uganda, there are promising signs that some of the plant-based remedies offered by medicine-men are not just affordable, but also effective, even in treating AIDS. Hills read his Declaration of Traditional Healers at the 13th International Conference on AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Africa, which summarized the important role of traditional medicine, stating: \"As traditional healers, we are the most trusted and accessible health care providers in our communities.  We have varied and valuable experience in treating AIDS-related illness and accept the great responsibility of continuing to do so.\"  Because this form of medicine is \"the most affordable and accessible system of health care for the majority of the African rural population,\" the African Union declared 2001 to 2010 to be the Decade for African Traditional Medicine with the goal of making \"safe, efficacious, quality, and affordable traditional medicines available to the vast majority of the people.\"   Excessive use of plants is an oecologic risk, as this may cause their extinction.   Section::::Relationship with modern medicine. \n Before the establishment of science-based medicine, traditional medicine was the dominant medical system for millions of people in Africa but the arrival of the Europeans was a noticeable turning point in the history of this ancient tradition and culture. Although modern scientific medicine is successful in developed countries, it doesn't have the same positive impact in many of the underdeveloped African countries.  Though Western practices can make an impact in health care practices, in certain areas such as in the spread of various diseases, it cannot integrate wholly into the culture and society.  This makes the traditional African practitioners a vital part of their health care system.  There are many reasons why the Western medical system has not been as effective in Africa as it has in more developed parts of the world.  Hospitals and medical facilities are difficult for many Africans to get to.  With vast areas of land and poor road and transportation systems, many native Africans have to travel immense distances on foot to reach help.  Once they arrive they are often required to wait in line for up to 8 hours, especially in urban areas, as the lack of clinics and resources cause over-crowding.  Patients are often not told the cause of their illness or much information about it all, so they have no way to prevent or prepare for it. \nThe technology used is usually of poor quality, which impairs the quality of treatment. Modern medicine can also be too expensive for the average African to afford, making it difficult for them to receive proper care.  Finally, Modern medicine removes native Africans from the culture and tradition and forces them into a setting that they are not comfortable with, away from their family and traditions which are of utmost importance to them.  They do not get the proper spiritual healing that their culture seeks and traditional ideology requires.   However, there has been more interest expressed recently in the effects of some of the medicinal plants of Africa.  \"The pharmaceutical industry has come to consider traditional medicine as a source for identification of bio-active agents that can be used in the preparation of synthetic medicine.\"  Pharmaceutical industries are looking into the medicinal effects of the most commonly and widely used plants to use in drugs.  It's apparent that there are some things that can be learned from traditional African practice. \nIn comparing the techniques of African healers and Western techniques, T. Adeoze Lambo, a Nigerian psychiatrist, stated in 1979, \"At about three years ago, we made an evaluation, a programme of their work, and compared this with our own, and we discovered that actually they were scoring almost sixty percent success in their treatment of neurosis. And we were scoring forty percent-in fact, less than forty percent.\"   Section::::Relationship with modern medicine.:Effectiveness.   Herbal medicines in Africa are generally not adequately researched, and are weakly regulated.  There is a lack of the detailed documentation of the traditional knowledge, which is generally transferred orally.  Several African medicinal plants have shown encouraging anti-trypanosomal effects but the research is only in the concept stage.  A small proportion of ethnoveterinary medicine plants in South Africa have been researched for biological activity.  Research identified favorable, possible future use of the \"Hypoxis\" species, (known locally as \"inkomfe\" or \"African potato\") in both ATM and modern medicine.  South African sangomas have been long and vocal advocates of a local traditional plant called \"unwele\" or \"kankerbos\" (\"Sutherlandia frutescens\") claiming it assists in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer and tuberculosis. \nSufficient preclinical data on \"Sutherlandia frutescens\" yields plausible hypotheses that may account for the reputed efficacy.  Section::::Relationship with modern medicine.:Safety.   A small proportion of ethnoveterinary medicine plants in South Africa have been researched for toxic effects.  The possible adverse effects of South African traditional medicines are not well documented; there has been limited research into mutagenic properties and heavy metal contamination.  Serious adverse effects, even death, can result from misidentification or misuse of healing plants.  For example, various aloe plants are widely used in TAM, but some varieties, such as \"Aloe globuligemma\", are toxic and can cause death.  The potential for ATMs and pharmacokinetic interactions is unknown, especially interactions between traditional treatments and pharmaceutical antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS.  Herbal treatments are frequently used in Africa as a primary treatment for HIV/AIDS and for HIV-related issues.  Collaboration with traditional healers has been recommended to determine what herbal remedies are used for HIV and to educate people supplying alternative treatments against unsafe practices.  Given the demands of the local population on the use of ATMs, it has been suggested that South African medical schools should review their curriculum regarding traditional, complementary and alternate medicines.

{"id":"KILT_106293","text":" Catecholamine  A catecholamine (; abbreviated CA) is a monoamine neurotransmitter, an organic compound that has a catechol (benzene with two hydroxyl side groups next to each other) and a side-chain amine.   Catechol can be either a free molecule or a substituent of a larger molecule, where it represents a 1,2-dihydroxybenzene group.   Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid tyrosine, which is derived from dietary sources as well as synthesis from phenylalanine.  Catecholamines are water-soluble and are 50%-bound to plasma proteins in circulation.   Included among catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and dopamine.  Release of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands is part of the fight-or-flight response.   Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.  Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein.  Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine.  Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine.   Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues.   Section::::Structure. \n Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain.   Section::::Production and degradation.   Section::::Production and degradation.:Location.   Catecholamines are produced mainly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and the postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system.  Dopamine, which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is largely produced in neuronal cell bodies in two areas of the brainstem: the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra, the latter of which contains neuromelanin-pigmented neurons.  The similarly neuromelanin-pigmented cell bodies of the locus coeruleus produce norepinephrine.  Epinephrine is produced in small groups of neurons in the human brain which express its synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine \"N\"-methyltransferase; these neurons project from a nucleus that is adjacent (ventrolateral) to the area postrema and from a nucleus in the dorsal region of the solitary tract.   Section::::Production and degradation.:Biosynthesis.   Dopamine is the first catecholamine synthesized from DOPA.  In turn, norepinephrine and epinephrine are derived from further metabolic modification of dopamine.  The enzyme dopamine hydroxylase requires copper as a cofactor (not shown in the diagram) and DOPA decarboxylase requires PLP (not shown in the diagram). \nThe rate limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis through the predominant metabolic pathway is the hydroxylation of -tyrosine to -DOPA.  Catecholamine synthesis is inhibited by alpha-methyl-\"p\"-tyrosine (AMPT), which inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase.  The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine are precursors for catecholamines.  Both amino acids are found in high concentrations in blood plasma and the brain.  In mammals, tyrosine can be formed from dietary phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, found in large amounts in the liver.  Insufficient amounts of phenylalanine hydroxylase result in phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder that leads to intellectual deficits unless treated by dietary manipulation.  Catecholamine synthesis is usually considered to begin with tyrosine.  The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts the amino acid -tyrosine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (-DOPA).  The hydroxylation of -tyrosine by TH results in the formation of the DA precursor -DOPA, which is metabolized by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC; see Cooper et al., 2002) to the transmitter dopamine.  This step occurs so rapidly that it is difficult to measure -DOPA in the brain without first inhibiting AADC. \nIn neurons that use DA as the transmitter, the decarboxylation of -DOPA to dopamine is the final step in formation of the transmitter; however, in those neurons using norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine (adrenaline) as transmitters, the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), which converts dopamine to yield norepinephrine, is also present. In still other neurons in which epinephrine is the transmitter, a third enzyme phenylethanolamine \"N\"-methyltransferase (PNMT) converts norepinephrine into epinephrine.  Thus, a cell that uses epinephrine as its transmitter contains four enzymes (TH, AADC, DBH, and PNMT), whereas norepinephrine neurons contain only three enzymes (lacking PNMT) and dopamine cells only two (TH and AADC).   Section::::Production and degradation.:Degradation.   Catecholamines have a half-life of a few minutes when circulating in the blood.  They can be degraded either by methylation by catechol-\"O\"-methyltransferases (COMT) or by deamination by monoamine oxidases (MAO).   MAOIs bind to MAO, thereby preventing it from breaking down catecholamines and other monoamines.   Catabolism of catecholamines is mediated by two main enzymes: catechol-\"O\"-methyltransferase (COMT) which is present in the synaptic cleft and cytosol of the cell and monoamine oxidase (MAO) which is located in the mitochondrial membrane. \nBoth enzymes require cofactors: COMT uses Mg as a cofactor while MAO uses FAD. The first step of the catabolic process is mediated by either MAO or COMT which depends on the tissue and location of catecholamines (for example degradation of catecholamines in the cleft is mediated by COMT because MAO is a mitochondrial enzyme).  The next catabolic steps in the pathway involve alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and aldehyde reductase.  The end product of epinephrine and norepinephrine is vanillylmandelic acid (MVA) which is excreted in the urine.  Dopamine catabolism leads to the production of homovanillic acid (HVA).   Section::::Function.   Section::::Function.:Modality.  Two catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine, act as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and as hormones in the blood circulation.  The catecholamine norepinephrine is a neuromodulator of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system but is also present in the blood (mostly through \"spillover\" from the synapses of the sympathetic system).   High catecholamine levels in blood are associated with stress, which can be induced from psychological reactions or environmental stressors such as elevated sound levels, intense light, or low blood sugar levels. \n Extremely high levels of catecholamines (also known as catecholamine toxicity) can occur in central nervous system trauma due to stimulation or damage of nuclei in the brainstem, in particular those nuclei affecting the sympathetic nervous system. In emergency medicine, this occurrence is widely known as a \"catecholamine dump\".   Extremely high levels of catecholamine can also be caused by neuroendocrine tumors in the adrenal medulla, a treatable condition known as pheochromocytoma.   High levels of catecholamines can also be caused by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) deficiency, known as Brunner syndrome.  As MAO-A is one of the enzymes responsible for degradation of these neurotransmitters, its deficiency increases the bioavailability of these neurotransmitters considerably.  It occurs in the absence of pheochromocytoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and carcinoid syndrome, but it looks similar to carcinoid syndrome with symptoms such as facial flushing and aggression.   Acute porphyria can cause elevated catecholamines.   Section::::Function.:Effects.   Catecholamines cause general physiological changes that prepare the body for physical activity (the fight-or-flight response).  Some typical effects are increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and a general reaction of the sympathetic nervous system.  Some drugs, like tolcapone (a central COMT-inhibitor), raise the levels of all the catecholamines. \n Catecholamine is secreted into urine after being broken down, and its secretion level can be measured for the diagnosis of illnesses associated with catecholamine levels in the body. Urine testing for catecholamine is used to detect pheochromocytoma.   Section::::Function.:Function in plants.   \"They have been found in 44 plant families, but no essential metabolic function has been established for them.  They are precursors of benzo[\"c\"]phenanthridine alkaloids, which are the active principal ingredients of many medicinal plant extracts.  CAs have been implicated to have a possible protective role against insect predators, injuries, and nitrogen detoxification.  They have been shown to promote plant tissue growth, somatic embryogenesis from in vitro cultures, and flowering.  CAs inhibit indole-3-acetic acid oxidation and enhance ethylene biosynthesis.  They have also been shown to enhance synergistically various effects of gibberellins.\"   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_23595810","text":" Raptor (rocket engine family)  Raptor is a staged combustion, methane-fueled rocket engine under development by SpaceX. The engines are powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in both the Merlin and Kestrel rocket engine families.  The earliest concepts for Raptor considered liquid hydrogen () as fuel rather than methane.  The Raptor engine is currently planned to have about two times the thrust of the Merlin 1D engine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle.   The current Raptor concept as announced in 2013 is \"a highly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars\".   A variety of Raptor engines are planned to be used on both stages of the super heavy-lift launch vehicle BFR, which will have a smaller number of engines than originally planned.   Section::::Description.   The Raptor engine is powered by subcooled liquid methane and subcooled liquid oxygen using a more efficient staged combustion cycle, a departure from the simpler 'open cycle' gas generator system and lox/kerosene propellants that current Merlin engines use. \nThe Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME, with hydrolox propellant) also used a staged combustion process, as do several Russian rocket engines including the RD-180 and the chamber pressure RD-191. The stated design size for the Raptor engine varied widely during 2012–2017 as detailed design continued, from a high target of of vacuum thrust to a more recent, much lower target of .  In its 2017 iteration, the operational engine is expected to have a vacuum I of 375 seconds and a sea-level I of 300 seconds.   The Raptor engine is designed for the use of deep cryogenic propellants—fluids cooled to near their freezing points, rather than nearer their boiling points which is more typical for cryogenic rocket engines.  The use of subcooled propellants increases propellant density to allow more propellant mass in tanks; the engine performance is also improved with sub cooled propellants.  Specific impulse is increased, and the risk of cavitation at inputs to the turbopumps is reduced due to the higher mass flow rate per unit power generated.  Engine ignition for all Raptor engines, both on the pad and in the air, will be by spark ignition, which will eliminate the pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) used for engine ignition on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. \n Raptor has been claimed to be able to deliver \"long life ... and more benign turbine environments\". Specifically, Raptor utilizes a full-flow staged combustion cycle, where 100 percent of the oxidizer—with a low-fuel ratio—will power the oxygen turbine pump, and 100 percent of the fuel—with a low-oxygen ratio—will power the methane turbine pump.  Both streams—oxidizer and fuel—will be mixed completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber.  Prior to 2014, only two full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands: the Soviet RD-270 project in the 1960s and the Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator in the mid-2000s.   Additional characteristics of the full-flow design, projected to further increase performance or reliability include:  BULLET::::- eliminating the fuel-oxidizer turbine interseal, which is a potential point of failure in more traditional engine designs  BULLET::::- lower pressures are required through the pumping system, increasing life span and further reducing risk of catastrophic failure  BULLET::::- ability to increase the combustion chamber pressure, thereby either increasing overall performance, or \"by using cooler gases, providing the same performance as a standard staged combustion engine but with much less stress on materials, thus significantly reducing material fatigue or [ \nengine] weight\".  The turbopump and many of the critical parts of the injectors for the initial engine development testing were, as of 2015, manufactured by using 3D printing, which increases the speed of development and iterative testing.  Forty percent (by mass) of the 2016 test stand engine was manufactured by 3D printing.   The Raptor engine uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors to admit propellants to the combustion chamber, rather than pintle injectors used on the previous Merlin rocket engines that SpaceX mass-produced for its Falcon family of launch vehicles.   Section::::History.   The engine development from 2009 to 2015 was funded exclusively through private investment by SpaceX, and not as a result of any funding from the US government.  In January 2016, SpaceX did agree with the US Air Force to take in defense department funding in order to develop a particular Raptor model: a prototype of a new upper-stage variant of the Raptor engine designed for potential use as an upper stage on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, with SpaceX agreeing to fund at least on the same upper-stage development project, on a minimum 2:1 private-to-government funding basis.   Section::::History.:Initial concept. \n An advanced rocket engine design project named \"Raptor\"—then a hydrolox engine—was first publicly discussed by SpaceX's Max Vozoff at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Commercial Crew/Cargo symposium in 2009. , SpaceX had a small number of staff working on the Raptor upper-stage engine, then still a /LOX concept, at a low level of priority.  Further mention of the development program occurred in 2011.  In March 2012, news accounts asserted that the Raptor upper-stage engine development program was underway, but that details were not being publicly released.   In October 2012, SpaceX publicly announced concept work on a rocket engine that would be \"several times as powerful as the Merlin 1 series of engines, and won't use Merlin's RP-1 fuel\", but declined to specify which fuel would be used.  They indicated that details on a new SpaceX rocket would be forthcoming in \"one to three years\" and that the large engine was intended for the next-generation launch vehicle using multiple of these large engines, that would be expected to launch payload masses of the order of to low Earth orbit, exceeding the payload mass capability of the NASA Space Launch System.   Section::::History.:Methane engine announcement and component development. \n In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for the propulsion division of SpaceX: developing methane-fueled rocket engines. He further indicated that the engine concept, codenamed Raptor, would now become a methane-based design, and that methane would be the fuel of choice for SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization.   Because of the presence of water underground and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars, methane, a simple hydrocarbon, can easily be synthesized on Mars using the Sabatier reaction.  In-situ resource production on Mars has been examined by NASA and found to be viable for oxygen, water, and methane production.  According to a study published by researchers from the Colorado School of Mines, in-situ resource utilization such as methane from Mars makes space missions more feasible technically and economically and enables reusability. \n When first mentioned by SpaceX in 2009, the term \"Raptor\" was applied exclusively to an upper-stage engine concept—and 2012 pronouncements indicated that it was then still a concept for an upper stage engine—but in early 2014 SpaceX confirmed that Raptor would be used both on a new second stage, as well as for the large (then, nominally a 10-meter-diameter) core of the then-named Mars Colonial Transporter (subsequently, in 2016, on both stages of the even larger ITS launch vehicle concept and then, in 2017 and 2018, on the currently-in-development 9-meter diameter BFR).  The earliest public hints that a staged-combustion methane engine was under consideration at SpaceX were given in May 2011 when SpaceX asked if the Air Force was interested in a methane-fueled engine as an option to compete with the mainline kerosene-fueled engine that had been requested in the USAF \"Reusable Booster System High Thrust Main Engine\" solicitation.   Public information released in November 2012 indicated that SpaceX might have a family of Raptor-designated rocket engines in mind; this was confirmed by SpaceX in October 2013. \nHowever, in March 2014 SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that the focus of the new engine development program is exclusively on the full-size Raptor engine; smaller subscale methalox engines were not planned on the development path to the very large Raptor engine.  In October 2013, SpaceX announced that they would be performing methane engine tests of Raptor engine components at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, and that SpaceX would add equipment to the existing test stand infrastructure in order to support liquid methane and hot gaseous methane engine component testing.  In April 2014, SpaceX completed the requisite upgrades and maintenance to the Stennis test stand to prepare for testing of Raptor components, and the engine component testing program began in earnest, focusing on the development of robust startup and shutdown procedures, something that is typically quite difficult to do for full-flow staged combustion cycle engines.  Component testing at Stennis also allowed hardware characterization and verification of proprietary analytical software models that SpaceX developed to push the technology on this engine cycle that had little prior development work in the West. \n October 2013 was the first time SpaceX disclosed a nominal design thrust of the Raptor engine——although early in 2014 they announced a Raptor engine with greater thrust, and in 2015, one with lower thrust that might better optimize thrust-to-weight.  In February 2014, Tom Mueller, the head of rocket engine development at SpaceX, revealed in a speech that Raptor was being designed for use on a vehicle where nine engines would \"put over 100 tons of cargo up to Mars\" and that the rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, producing greater than .  A June 2014 talk by Mueller provided more specific engine performance target specifications indicating of sea-level thrust, of vacuum thrust, and a specific impulse (I) of for a vacuum version.  Earlier information had estimated the design I under vacuum conditions as only 363 s. Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011–2015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene—methane is cleaner burning—and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to \"live off the land\" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. \n SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015. 76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April–August 2015.   SpaceX completed its planned testing at NASA Stennis in 2014 and 2015.   In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around , much lower than older statements mentioned.  This brought into question much of the speculation surrounding a 9-engine booster, as he stated \"there will be a lot of [  engines]\".  By August 2015, an Elon Musk statement surfaced that indicated the oxidizer to fuel ratio of the Mars-bound engine would be approximately 3.8 to 1.   In January 2016, the US Air Force awarded a development contract to SpaceX to develop a prototype version of its methane-fueled reusable Raptor engine for use on the upper stage of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which required double-matching funding by SpaceX of at least .  Work under the contract is expected to be completed in 2018, with engine performance testing to be done at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.   Section::::History.:Engine development and testing. \n Initial development testing of Raptor methane engine components was done at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, where SpaceX added equipment to the existing infrastructure in order to support liquid methane engine testing. Initial testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stands at the E-2 complex at Stennis were not large enough to test the full Raptor engine.  The development Raptor engine discussed in the October 2013 time frame relative to Stennis testing was designed to generate more than vacuum thrust.  A revised, higher-thrust, specification was discussed by the company in February 2014, but it was unclear whether that higher thrust was something that would be achieved with the initial development engines.   Raptor engine component testing began in May 2014 at the E-2 test complex which SpaceX modified to support methane engine tests.  The first items tested were single Raptor injector elements, various designs of high-volume gas injectors.   The modifications to the test stands made by SpaceX are now a part of the Stennis test infrastructure and are available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease was completed.   SpaceX successfully completed a \"round of main injector testing in late 2014\" and a \"full-power test of the oxygen preburner component\" for Raptor by June 2015. \nTests continued at least into September 2015.  By 2016, SpaceX had constructed a new engine test stand at their site of McGregor in central Texas that can handle the larger thrust of the full Raptor engine.   By August 2016, SpaceX confirmed that a Raptor engine had been shipped to the testing site in McGregor for development tests, and the development Raptor did an initial 9-second firing test on 26 September 2016, the day before Musk's talk at the International Aeronautical Congress.  The 2016 development engine had \"an expansion ratio of just 150, the maximum possible within Earth’s atmosphere\" to prevent flow separation problems.   By August 2016, the first integrated Raptor rocket engine, manufactured at the SpaceX Hawthorne facility in California, shipped to the McGregor rocket engine test facility in Texas for development testing.  The engine had thrust, which makes it approximately one-third the size of the full-scale Raptor engine planned for flight tests in 2019/2020 timeframe.  It is the first full-flow staged-combustion methalox engine ever to reach a test stand.   On 26 September 2016, Elon Musk tweeted two images of the first test firing of an integrated Raptor in SpaceX's McGregor test complex. \nOn the same day Musk revealed that their target performance for Raptor was a vacuum specific impulse of 382 seconds, with a thrust of with a chamber pressure of and an expansion ratio of 150 for an altitude optimized version. When asked if the nozzle diameter for such version was , he stated that it was pretty close to that dimension.  He also disclosed that it used multi-stage turbopumps.  On the 27th he clarified that 150 expansion ratio was for the development version, that the production vacuum version would have an expansion ratio of 200.   Substantial additional technical details of the ITS propulsion were summarized in a technical article on the Raptor engine published the next week.   By September 2017, the development Raptor engine—with chamber pressure—had undergone 1200 seconds of test fire testing in ground-test stands across 42 main engine tests, with the longest test being 100 seconds (which is limited by the capacity of the ground-test propellant tanks).  , the first version of the flight engine is intended to operate at a chamber pressure of 250 bar, with the intent to raise it to 300 bar at a later time. \n By September 2017, the 200 Bar sub-scale test engine, with a thrust of and \"a new alloy to help its oxygen-rich turbopump resist oxidization, ... had completed 1200 seconds of firings across 42 tests.\"  While plans for Raptor flight testing have consistently been on the new-generation fiber-composite-material construction flight vehicles since 2016, the specific vehicle was not clarified until October 2017, when it was indicated that initial suborbital test flights would occur with a BFR spaceship.   In November 2016, the first flight tests of the Raptor engine were projected to be on the very large -diameter ITS launch vehicle, no earlier than the early 2020s.   By July 2017, the plan had been modified to do flight testing on a much smaller launch vehicle and spacecraft, and the new system architecture had \"evolved quite a bit\" since the very large \"ITS launch vehicle\" design concept from 2016.  A key driver of the 2017 architecture was to make the new system useful for substantial Earth-orbit and Cislunar launches so that the new system might pay for itself, in part, through economic spaceflight activities in the near-Earth space zone. \n Elon Musk announced in September 2017 that the initial flight platform for any Raptor engine would be some part of the BFR launch vehicle. BFR is a -diameter launch vehicle.   In October 2017, Musk clarified that \"[  initial flight testing will be with] a full-scale 9-meter-diameter ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance ...  [  projected to be] fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don’t need the high area ratio, deep-space Raptor engines.\"   Notably, Musk also announced that the new Raptor-powered BFR launch vehicle was planned to entirely replace both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon spacecraft in the existing operational SpaceX fleet in the early 2020s, initially aiming at the Earth-orbit market, but SpaceX is explicitly designing in substantial capability to the spacecraft vehicles to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars mission environment as well.  SpaceX intends this approach to bring significant cost savings which will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the new launch vehicle design. \nIn addition to orbital spaceflight missions, BFR is being considered for the point-to-point Earth transportation market, with ~30–60 minute flights to nearly anywhere on the planet.  The first flight version of the Raptor engine planned for the \"Starship\" hopper arrived in McGregor, Texas in late January 2019.   On 3 February 2019, SpaceX performed the first test of a flight version engine.  The test lasted two seconds with the engine operating at 60 percent of rated thrust at a chamber pressure of .   Just four days later, the test engine achieved the power levels needed for use in Super Heavy and Starship.  The engine reached 172 metric tons of force (1687 kN) with a chamber pressure of .  The test was conducted using warm propellant, with expectations of a 10% to 20% increase in performance when switching to deep cryogenic temperatures for the propellant.   On 10 February 2019, Musk announced on Twitter that the flight version engine had attained the chamber combustion pressure of on a test stand. \n By March, serial number 2 (SN2) of the flight version Raptor engine had been delivered to the SpaceX South Texas launch site east of Brownsville, Texas for system integration testing on the \"Starship\" flight test rocket, the first test article of \"Starship\", approximately one year ahead of schedule. SN2 was used for two tethered integration tests of the flight test \"hopper\" in early April.  Serial numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 had all made it to the test stand by early July, but the first three had issues of various sorts and SpaceX did not try any flight tests of the Starhopper test vehicle.  SN6 was still under test on the ground test stand as of 8 July 2019.   The first flight test of a Raptor engine occurred on 25 July 2019 at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site.  Unusually, for initial flight tests of orbital-class rocket engines, this was not a full-duration burn but just a 22-second test.  SpaceX is developing their next-generation rocket to be reusable from the beginning, just like an aircraft, and thus needs to start with narrow flight test objectives, while still aiming to land the rocket successfully to be used subsequently in further tests to expand the flight envelope.   Section::::Versions. \n Section::::Versions.:IAC 2016 proposed designs.  At the IAC meetings September 2016, Musk mentioned several Raptor engine designs that could be used on the ITS launch vehicle by late in the decade.  In addition, a much smaller subscale engine had been built for test and validation of the new full-flow staged-combustion cycle engine.  At that time, this first \"subscale\" Raptor development engine had been tested on a ground test stand for only one brief firing.   BULLET::::- \"Raptor subscale development engine\"  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 40  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 200  Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2017.   At the IAC meetings of September 2017, Elon Musk announced that a smaller Raptor engine—with slightly over half as much thrust as the 2016 proposed designs—would be used on the BFR rocket than had been used on the ITS launch vehicle design unveiled a year earlier.  Additionally, fewer engines would be used on each stage.  BFR would have 31 Raptors on the first stage and 6 on the second stage, whereas the ITS launch vehicle design had 42 larger Raptor engines on the first stage and 9 of that same large size on the second stage. \nThe engine design remains full-flow staged combustion cycle design using subcooled liquid-methane/liquid-oxygen propellant, just like the larger 2016 engine design. \"Version 1\" of the flight engine is designed to operate at of chamber pressure; but SpaceX expects to increase this to in later iterations.  The flight engine is designed for extreme reliability, aiming to support the airline-level of safety required by the point-to-point Earth transportation market.   BULLET::::- The sea-level model Raptor engine design, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to have thrust at sea-level with an I of 330s increasing to an I of 356s in the vacuum of space.   BULLET::::- The vacuum model Raptor, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to exert force with an I of 375s.   Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2018.   In the BFR update given in September 2018, Musk showed video of a 71 second burn of a Raptor engine, and stated that \"this is the Raptor engine that will power BFR, both the ship and the booster; it's the same engine. ...  approximately a engine aiming for roughly chamber pressure. ...  If you had it at a high expansion ratio, has the potential to have a specific impulse of 380.\" \nThe update also included a redesigned BFR upper stage with seven sea-level Raptor engines instead of the three sea-level and four vacuum on the previous design.  Later versions will be split into a sea-level design and a vacuum-optimized design again.   Section::::Applications.   As of September 2016, the Raptor engine was slated to be used in three spaceflight vehicles making up the two launch stages of an ITS launch vehicle stack.  The first stage is always an \"Interplanetary booster\" while the second stage may be either an \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an \"ITS tanker\" (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations nearer to Earth).   The SpaceX 2016-design of the Interplanetary booster was announced with 42 sea-level optimized Raptors in the first stage of the ITS launch vehicle with a total of of thrust.  The SpaceX Interplanetary Spaceship—which made up the second stage of the ITS launch vehicle on Earth launches was also an interplanetary spacecraft carrying cargo and passengers to beyond-Earth-orbit destinations after on-orbit refueling—was slated in the 2016 design to use six vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three Raptors with sea-level nozzles for maneuvering. \n The SpaceX 2017-design is a much smaller launch vehicle, 9 meters in diameter rather than 12 meters for the ITS launch vehicle, and is currently known by a codename \"BFR\". The BFR booster was originally planned to have 31 sea-level optimized Raptors with a total of of thrust.  The BFR spaceship (Starship) and tanker will use four vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three sea-level Raptors for maneuvering.   SpaceX will build the flight-article Starship and Super Heavy vehicles at the SpaceX South Texas build site.   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_16581","text":" Johnny Bench  Johnny Lee Bench (born December 7, 1947) is an American former professional baseball catcher who played in the Major Leagues for the Cincinnati Reds from 1967 to 1983 and is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.  Bench is a 14-time All-Star selection and a two-time National League Most Valuable Player.  He was a key member of the Big Red Machine that won six division titles, four National League pennants, and two consecutive World Series championships.http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com Known for his prowess on both offense and defense, ESPN has called him the greatest catcher in baseball history.   Section::::Major League Baseball career.   Section::::Major League Baseball career.:1960s.   Born and raised in Oklahoma, Bench is one-eighth Choctaw; he played baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at Binger-Oney High School His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher.  As a 17-year-old, Bench was selected 36th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August 1967.  He hit only .163, but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them Hall of Famer Ted Williams. \nWilliams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be \"a Hall of Famer for sure!\" Williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Bench was elected to Cooperstown.   During a 1968 spring training game, Bench was catching right-hander Jim Maloney, an eight-year veteran.  Maloney was once a hard thrower, but injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball.  Maloney nevertheless insisted on repeatedly \"shaking off\" his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that Bench had called for.  When an exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, \"Your fastball's not popping,\" Maloney replied with an epithet.  To prove to Maloney that his fastball was no longer effective, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher's mitt and caught the fastball barehanded.  Bench was the Reds' catcher on April 30, 1969, when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the   In 1968, the 20-year-old Bench impressed many in his first he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs.  This marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. \nHe also won the 1968 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie. He made 102 assists in 1968, which marked the first time in 23 years that a catcher had more than 100 assists in a season.   During the 1960s, Bench also served in the United States Army Reserve as a member of the 478th Engineer Battalion, which was based across the Ohio River from Cincinnati at Fort Thomas, Kentucky.  This unit included several of his teammates, among them Pete Rose.  In the winter of 1970–1971 he was part of Bob Hope's USO Tour of Vietnam.   Section::::Major League Baseball career.:1970s.   In 1970, Bench had his finest statistical season.  At age 22, he became the youngest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award.  He hit .293, led the National League with 45 home runs and a franchise-record 148 runs batted in as the Reds won the NL West Division.  The Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Championship Series, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five games in the World Series.   Bench had another strong year in 1972, winning the MVP Award for a second time. \nHe led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the NL pennant in the deciding fifth game over the Pittsburgh Pirates. One of his most dramatic home runs was likely his ninth-inning, lead off, opposite field home run in that fifth NLCS game.  The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3.  It was hailed after the game as \"one of the great clutch home runs of all time.\"  However, the Reds lost the World Series to a strong Oakland Athletics team in seven games.   After the 1972 season, Bench had a growth removed from his lung; he remained productive, but never again hit forty home runs in a season.  In 1973, Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10½-game deficit to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown.  In the NLCS, Cincinnati met a New York Mets team that won the NL East with an unimpressive record, 16½ games behind the Reds. \nBut the Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Jon Matlack. Bench's bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning to put the Mets into the World Series.   In 1974, Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season.  The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the Los Angeles Dodgers.  In 1975, the Reds finally broke through in the post season.  Bench contributed 28 home runs and 110 RBI.  Cincinnati swept the Pirates in three games to win the NLCS, and defeated the Boston Red Sox in a memorable seven-game World Series.   Bench struggled with ailing shoulders in 1976,  Bench bounced back in 1977 to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs but the Dodgers won two straight NL pennants.  The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in 1979, but were swept in three straight in the NLCS by the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n Section::::Major League Baseball career.:1980s.  For the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out from behind the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base).  The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, \"Johnny Bench Night\" at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd.  He retired at the end of the season at age 35.   Section::::MLB career statistics.   Bench had 2,048 hits for a .267 career batting average with 389 home runs and 1,376 RBI during his 17-year Major League career, all spent with the Reds.  He retired as the career home run leader for catchers, a record which stood until surpassed by Carlton Fisk and the current record holder, Mike Piazza.  Bench still holds the Major League record for the most grand slam home runs by a catcher with 10.  In his career, Bench earned 10 Gold Gloves, was named to the National League All-Star team 14 times, and won two Most Valuable Player Awards.  He led the National League three times in caught stealing percentage and ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage. \nHe caught 118 shutouts during his career, ranking him 12th all-time among major league catchers. Bench also won such awards as the Lou Gehrig Award (1975), the Babe Ruth Award (1976), and the Hutch Award (1981).   Bench popularized the hinged catcher's mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs.  He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand.  The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch.  By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment.  Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.   Section::::Personal life.   Bench has been married four times.  Once hailed as \"baseball's most-eligible bachelor,\" he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who had previously dated Joe Namath. \nFour days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Bench suggested that his wife accept \"Hustler\" magazine's offer for her to pose nude for $25,000.  They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, \"Now I'm done with two things I hate: baseball and you\"), divorcing after just 13 months.  \"I tried.  I even hand-squeezed orange juice,\" Chesser told Phil Donahue in December 1975.  \"I don't think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like.\"  After returning to Manhattan, Chesser said, \"Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person.   Before Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor.  They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named for Bob Hope and Bobby Knight, and Bench's hometown), before divorcing in 1995.  They shared custody of their son.  \"He was, and is, a great dad,\" according to Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. \nBench's third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997, Johnny filed for divorce in 2000 on grounds of one too many people being involved with his wife, while his fourth marriage took place in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in Palm Springs with their two sons, Justin (born 2006) and Josh (born 2010), Johnny had the urge to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014–17, so the family scouted homes in Palm Beach Gardens.  In the end, Lauren decided she wasn't going to move to Florida, so she and Johnny divorced; as of 2018, Bench has primary custody of the boys.   Section::::Honors and post-career activities.   Bench was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1989 alongside Carl Yastrzemski.  He was elected in his first year of eligibility, and appeared on 96% of the ballots, the third-highest percentage at that time.  Three years earlier, Bench had been inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1986 and his uniform #5 was retired by the team.  He is currently on the Board of Directors for the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. \nIn 1989, he became the first individual baseball player to appear on a Wheaties box, a cereal he ate as a child.  For a time in the 1980s Bench was a commercial spokesman for Krylon paint, featuring a memorable catchphrase: \"I'm Johnny Bench, and this is Johnny Bench's bench.\"    In 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical \"Damn Yankees\", which also included Gwen Verdon and Gary Sandy.  He also hosted the television series \"The Baseball Bunch\" from 1982 to 1985.  A cast of boys and girls from the Tucson, Arizona, area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats.  The Chicken provided comic relief and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared as \"The Dugout Wizard.\"   In 1986, Bench and Don Drysdale did the backup contests or ABC's Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts (Al Michaels and Jim Palmer were the primary commentating crew).  Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games.  Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. \nWhile Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio to help Brent Musburger call that year's National League Championship Series.  Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio's World Series coverage alongside Jack Buck and later Vin Scully from 1989-1993.  In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for NBC/The Baseball Network's coverage of the All-Star Game from Pittsburgh.   After turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the Senior PGA Tour.  He has a home at the Mission Hills-Gary Player Course in Rancho Mirage, California.   In 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.  He was the highest-ranking catcher.  Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher.  As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team.   Starting with the 2000 college baseball season, the best collegiate catcher annually receives the Johnny Bench Award. \nNotable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton.  In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book \"Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches\" with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press.  An autobiography published in 1979 called \"Catch You Later\" was co-authored with William Brashler.  Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments.   In a September 2008 interview with Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network, Johnny Bench, who was watching a Cleveland Indians/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park, did an impression of late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray after Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, a native of Cincinnati, made a tough play.  While knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Red Sox, he related a story that then-Reds manager Sparky Anderson told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer Phil Niekro.  Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro's catcher, too.   On September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at Great American Ball Park. \nThe larger-than-life bronze statue by Tom Tsuchiya, shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner. Bench called the unveiling of his statue his \"greatest moment.\"   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_10271052","text":" Rhymed prose  Rhymed prose is a literary form and literary genre, written in unmetrical rhymes.  This form has been known in many different cultures.  In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing.  In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry.   Section::::Arabic culture and influences.   In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called \"saj'\".  An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is \"maqama\".  It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's \"Gulestan\") and Turkish ().   \"Maqama\" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world.  It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer.  The corresponding works were called \"maqamat\" or \"mahbarot\" (\"mahberot\", e.g., \"Mahbarot Emmanuel\", by Immanuel the Roman).   Arabic rhymed prose was used not only for entertainment or eulogy.   Section::::Chinese culture. \n A Chinese form of elaborate rhymed prose called \"fu\" developed as the major literary form particularly associated with the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). Generally, the \"fu\" type of rhymed prose describes an object, feeling, or other particular subject, using an exhaustive catalog of details and associated vocabulary, and characteristically used both rhyme and prose, variable line lengths, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and some parallelism.  Topics of \"fu\" rhymed prose could vary from the exalted to the everyday: it was sometimes used to eloquently glorify the emperors; but, other topics of well-known \"fu\" included encyclopedic catalogs of minerals, types of pasta, and the species of plants a poet might expect to encounter during an exile due to political disfavor.  The style of the National Anthem of the Republic of China follows that of a four-character poem (四言詩), also called a four-character rhymed prose (四言韻文), which first appeared during the Zhou Dynasty.  The \"fu\" literary form was at first classed with poetry, but later bibliographies classified \"fu\" at the head of prose works.   Section::::Indian culture. \n Rhymed prose was common in early Khariboli Hindi texts, such as \"Premsagar\" (\"Prem Sagur\") by Lallu Lal and \"Naasiketopaakhyan\" by Sadal Mishra, in early 19th century but gradually fell into disuse. The paper traces possible origins of the Hindi rhyming prose in Islamic and Sanskrit literature.   Section::::European cultures.   Rhymed prose was a characteristic feature of the Divine Office until the end of the 12th century.  A type of the \"rhymed office\" were offices in rhymed prose, i.e., in irregular rhythm.  Later it was gradually replaced by rhythmical office.  They were popular in France and Germany, and a number of prominent composers of rhymed offices are known.   A kind of jesting rhymed prose in Russian culture is known as \"rayok\".   Rhymed prose is present in many books for small children.

{"id":"KILT_18845973","text":" John Bosley Ziegler  John Bosley Ziegler (\"ca.\"  1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba.  He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team.  It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act.  In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category.  It's a disgrace.  Who plays sports for fun anymore?\".  Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983.   Section::::Biography.   Section::::Biography.:Early life.   Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. \nHe was descended from three generations of doctors going back to the American Civil War, and his father had been both practicing physician and a scientist who had discovered the salt tablet.  He served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific in World War II, where he suffered extensive bullet wounds.  His experience of surgery and convalescence lead to a speciality in recuperative medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School.  He served his internship and residency at Marine hospitals in Norfolk Virginia and Mobile Alabama, before completing a two-year residence in neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans.  In 1954 after he settled in Olney, Maryland he specialized in the treatment of handicapped and seriously injured patients whilst conducting part-time chemistry research at Ciba Pharmaceuticals in Summit, N.J.  He became an enthusiastic weightlifter who pumped iron at the York Barbell Club, which was at the center of American fitness training thanks to its owner Bob Hoffman.  Hoffman had competed with Joe Weider and Charles Atlas for the title of Mr America and wrote the book \"Weight Lifting\" in 1939.  Ziegler's scientific credentials supplemented Hoffman's bodybuilding theories.  Ziegler befriended weightlifter and bodybuilder champion John Grimek who was employed by Hoffman.   Section::::Biography.:Developing anabolic steroids. \n In October 1954, Ziegler, went to Vienna with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physicist who, over \"a few drinks\", repeatedly asked \"What are you giving your boys?\"  When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone.  Returning to America, Ziegler tried weak doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on three lifters, John Grimek, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara.  All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce, but there were side-effects.  With the research assistance of Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ziegler began to look for synthetic substance that would mimic testosterone.  Working at CIBA allowed Ziegler access to books and records from Germany where experiments with testosterone had been carried out by the Nazis, and which had been confiscated by the United States after the war.  Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the U.S. in 1958 by Ciba.   Ziegler gave Dianabol to the entire U.S. Olympic weightlifting team in Rome in 1960, but they still lost to the Soviets. \nHe gave up experimentation with athletes when he learned that some who had taken 20 times the recommended dose of Dianabol had developed a liver condition. He was quoted in \"Science\" in 1972 saying \"I lost interest in fooling with IQ's of that caliber.  Now it's about as widespread among these idiots as marijuana.\"  In later years Ziegler regretted introducing AAS to athletes.  He recollected \"but I wish to God now I’d never done it.  I’d like to go back and take that whole chapter out of my life.\"   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids  BULLET::::- Doping in sports  Section::::External links.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.

The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.

By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

{"id":"KILT_21913729","text":" Modern Hebrew poetry  Modern Hebrew poetry is poetry written in the Hebrew language.  It was pioneered by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, and it was developed by the Haskalah movements, that saw poetry as the most quality genre for Hebrew writing.  The first Haskalah poet, who heavily influenced the later poets, was Naphtali Hirz Wessely, at the end of the 18th Century, and after him came Shalom HaCohen, Max Letteris, Abraham Dob Bär Lebensohn, his son Micah Joseph, Judah Leib Gordon and others.  Haskalah poetry was greatly influenced by the contemporary European poetry, as well as the poetry of the previous ages, especially Biblical poetry and pastoralism.  It was mostly a didactic form of poetry, and dealt with the world, the public, and contemporary trends, but not the individual.  A secular Galician Jew, Naftali Herz Imber, wrote the lyrics to HaTikva in 1878; this later became the national anthem of Israel.   In the age after the Haskalah, many prominent poets were associated with Hovevei Zion.  They included Shaul Tchernihovsky and Haim Nahman Bialik, who would later be considered Israel's national poet.  They let go of the genre principles that were widely accepted at their time, and began writing personal poems, about the human being and the soul. \nIn the Zionist national revival period, many arose as the literary heirs to Bialik, and the focal point of Hebrew poetry moved from Europe to the land of Israel. Women became prominent poets (Yokheved Bat Miryam, Esther Raab, Rachel and others).  An expressionist genre also developed, as exemplified by Uri Zvi Greenberg and David Fogel.   In the 1930s and 1940s, a neo-symbolic style emerged as well, in Avraham Shlonsky, then Nathan Alterman, and then the Palmach age.   In the 1950s and 1960s, poets who had been raised in Israel or the British Mandate of Palestine were active.  The poets Natan Zakh, David Avidan, Yehuda Amihai and Dahlia Ravikovitch rebelled against the style of Shlonsky and Alterman.  At the same time a line of religious poets led by such figures as Yosef Zvi Rimon and Zelda emerged.  These movements continue to be active to the present day.   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_39407203","text":" Mental health in Southeast Africa  Mental health in Southeast Africa is a concern, where mental illness is prevalent.  Mental health issues in Africa are often viewed as the \"silent crisis\" since they are often given lower priority in a region of Africa where international aid is focused on communicable diseases and malnutrition.  Each country in Southeast Africa is consistently confronted with barriers that make mental health policies a challenge to implement, including the lack of policy, social and cultural barriers, the role of traditional medicine, HIV/AIDS, and the stigma surrounding mental health issues.   Section::::Priority of mental health.   Professor Anyang' Nyong'o wrote a letter on June 23, 2011 to the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights, stating, \"Currently there is a very big gap existing between the mental health needs of Kenyans and the existing mental health services at all levels of the health care services delivery system.\"   Although there is a lack of attention to mental health in the healthcare systems, it is a major issue in Southeast African countries.  Efforts have been made in some countries to allocate funding to mental health initiatives.  Uganda's policies are a prime example of a successful effort to improve mental health in Southeast Africa. \nIn 2006–2007, after undertaking an initial situational analysis of Uganda's mental health system, a new mental health policy was created. The vision for the project in Uganda is to eliminate, mental health issues, neurological disorders, and substance use from the population.  From this vision, guiding principles were implemented, key priority areas were identified, policy objectives were selected, and the Uganda Ministry of Health began to make mental health a priority.  The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to work with the developing nations of Africa to implement strategies to improve mental health situations and treatment in these countries.  The few countries that have mental health policies in place, were created prior to 1990, and are in dire need of updating.  Uganda had achieved great success with their new mental health policies and is working in close cooperation with the WHO to finalize their health-care policy.  The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward.   Section::::Perspectives.   The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices.  Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. \nAccording to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent.  For an example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.  In a CNN series, \"African Voices\", leading psychiatrist Frank Njenga, states that when a patient has some form of illness such as depression or schizophrenia, community members and traditional healers often look at it as being possessed by demons or witchcraft.   Section::::Causes of mental illnesses.   Some mental illnesses have been linked to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters.  These neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate.  If these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not properly transmit through the brain, leading to symptoms of mental illness. \nIn addition, defects in or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions.  Many socioeconomic factors may contribute to mental health.  Such as, disease, political unrest, violence, and any kind of addiction.  These may all play a role in the high incident of mental illness in Southeast Africa.  Adequate care may not be available to sufferers, due to the stigma that surrounds people dealing with mental illness.  The reversal of this stigma, is due to the lack of educational resources .  In Southeast Africa many people have developed post-traumatic stress disorder relating to genocide, civil war, tribal clashes, and refugee situations.  Particularly in Rwanda and Uganda, post-traumatic stress disorder affects a significant number of the population, due to recent conflict, genocide, and crimes against humanity.

{"id":"KILT_22926","text":" Poetry  Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \"poiesis\", \"making\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.   Poetry has a very long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry was developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys.  Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE, while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry.  The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", was written in Sumerian.  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese \"Shijing\", or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit \"Vedas\", Zoroastrian \"Gathas\", and the Homeric epics, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". \nAncient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's \"Poetics\", focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, prosaic forms of writing.   Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses.  Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects.  The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations.  Similarly, figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived.  Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.   Some poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes.  Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. \nMuch modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.   Section::::History.   Some scholars believe that the art of poetry may predate literacy.   Others, however, suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing.   The oldest surviving epic poem, the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", dates from the 3rd millenniumBCE in Sumer (in Mesopotamia, now Iraq), and was written in cuneiform script on clay tablets and, later, on papyrus.  A tablet dating to 2000BCE describes an annual rite in which the king symbolically married and mated with the goddess Inanna to ensure fertility and prosperity; some have labelled it the world's oldest love poem.  An example of Egyptian epic poetry is \"The Story of Sinuhe\" (c. 1800 BCE). \n Other ancient epic poetry includes the Greek epics, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\"; the Avestan books, the \"Gathic Avesta\" and the \"Yasna\"; the Roman national epic, Virgil's \"Aeneid\" (written between 29 and 19 BCE); and the Indian epics, the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". Epic poetry, including the \"Odyssey\", the \"Gathas\", and the Indian \"Vedas\", appears to have been composed in poetic form as an aid to memorization and oral transmission in prehistoric and ancient societies.   Other forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs.  The earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of Chinese poetry, the \"Shijing\", were initially lyrics.   The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in \"poetics\"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry.  Some ancient societies, such as China's through her \"Shijing\" (\"Classic of Poetry\"), developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance. \nMore recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and Matsuo Bashō's \"Oku no Hosomichi\", as well as differences in content spanning Tanakh religious poetry, love poetry, and rap.  Section::::History.:Western traditions.   Classical thinkers in the West employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry.  Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the perceived underlying purposes of the genre.  Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.   Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, as well as in Europe during the Renaissance.  Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which they generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure. \n This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought-process. English Romantic poet John Keats termed this escape from logic \"Negative capability\".  This \"romantic\" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic.  This approach remained influential into the 20th century.   During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade.  In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.   Section::::History.:20th-century and 21st-century disputes.   Some 20th-century literary theorists, relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.  The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media.  Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided. \n The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means.  While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.   Recently, postmodernism has come to regard more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also different genres of poetry as having meaning only as cultural artifacts.  Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text (hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.  Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that once made sense within a tradition such as the Western canon. \n The early 21st-century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic Geoffrey Hartman (1929-2016) used the phrase \"the anxiety of demand\" to describe the contemporary response to older poetic traditions as \"being fearful that the fact no longer has a form\", building on a trope introduced by Emerson.  Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either \"form\" or \"fact\" could predominate, that one need simply \"Ask the fact for the form.\"  This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as Bloom (1930- ), who has stated: \"The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's.\"   Section::::Elements.   Section::::Elements.:Prosody.   Prosody is the study of the meter, rhythm, and intonation of a poem.  Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. \nMeter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.   Section::::Elements.:Prosody.:Rhythm.   The methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions.  Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches.  Japanese is a mora-timed language.  Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish are called syllable-timed languages.  Stress-timed languages include English, Russian and, generally, German.  Varying intonation also affects how rhythm is perceived.  Languages can rely on either pitch or tone.  Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek.  Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.   Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line.  In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). \nIn the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.   The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three.  Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation.  Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.  Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. \n Classical Chinese poetics, based on the tone system of Middle Chinese, recognized two kinds of tones: the level (平 \"píng\") tone and the oblique (仄 \"zè\") tones, a category consisting of the rising (上 \"sháng\") tone, the departing (去 \"qù\") tone and the entering (入 \"rù\") tone. Certain forms of poetry placed constraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.   The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry.  In the case of free verse, rhythm is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter.  Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry.  Jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm as an alternative to accentual rhythm.   Section::::Elements.:Prosody.:Meter.   In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic metrical foot and the number of feet per line.  The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: tetrameter for four feet and hexameter for six feet, for example. \nThus, \"iambic pentameter\" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the \"iamb\". This metric system originated in ancient Greek poetry, and was used by poets such as Pindar and Sappho, and by the great tragedians of Athens.  Similarly, \"dactylic hexameter\", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the \"dactyl\".  Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek epic poetry, the earliest extant examples of which are the works of Homer and Hesiod.  Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including William Shakespeare and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, respectively. \nThe most common metrical feet in English are:  BULLET::::- iamb – one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (e.g. des-cribe, in-clude, re-tract)  BULLET::::- trocheeone stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (e.g. pic-ture, flow-er)  BULLET::::- dactyl – one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (e.g. an-no-tate, sim-i-lar)  BULLET::::- anapaesttwo unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (e.g. com-pre-hend)  BULLET::::- spondeetwo stressed syllables together (e.g. heart-beat, four-teen)  BULLET::::- pyrrhictwo unstressed syllables together (rare, usually used to end dactylic hexameter)  There are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry.  Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds. \n Each of these types of feet has a certain \"feel,\" whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse.  Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of stress, as well as the differing pitches and lengths of syllables.   There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different \"feet\" is in describing meter.  For example, Robert Pinsky has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.  Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity.  Vladimir Nabokov noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.   Section::::Elements.:Prosody.:Metrical patterns. \n Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition.  For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop.  Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.  Regularity can vary between language.  In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English. \n Some common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:  BULLET::::- Iambic pentameter (John Milton, \"Paradise Lost\"; William Shakespeare, \"Sonnets\")  BULLET::::- Dactylic hexameter (Homer, \"Iliad\"; Virgil, \"Aeneid\")  BULLET::::- Iambic tetrameter (Andrew Marvell, \"To His Coy Mistress\"; Alexander Pushkin, \"Eugene Onegin\"; Robert Frost, \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\")  BULLET::::- Trochaic octameter (Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Raven\")  BULLET::::- Trochaic tetrameter (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \"The Song of Hiawatha\"; the Finnish national epic, \"The Kalevala\", is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)  BULLET::::- Alexandrine (Jean Racine, \"Phèdre\")  Section::::Elements.:Rhyme, alliteration, assonance.  Rhyme, alliteration, assonance and consonance are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound.  They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.  They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created.  For example, Chaucer used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic. \n Rhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"internal rhyme\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem.  The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms.  English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.  The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.   Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words.  Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry.  The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. \nThis can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.   Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.  Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.  Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word.  Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.   Section::::Elements.:Rhyme, alliteration, assonance.:Rhyming schemes.   In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets.  However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition.  Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes.  Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. \nRhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.  Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods.  Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.   Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme.  This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.  Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"enclosed rhyme\") is used in such forms as the Petrarchan sonnet.  Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the ottava rima and terza rima. \nThe types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the main article.  Section::::Elements.:Form in poetry.   Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras.  Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in free verse.  But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.  Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.   Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos.  Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and calligraphy.  These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called \"poetic forms\" or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.   Section::::Elements.:Form in poetry.:Lines and stanzas.   Poetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as lineation.  These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. \nLines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.  See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.   Lines of poems are often organized into stanzas, which are denominated by the number of lines included.  Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on.  These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm.  For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.   Other poems may be organized into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.  Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.   In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. \nExamples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem.  For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.   In some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined.  In skaldic poetry, the dróttkvætt stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance.  In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word).  Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee.  The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.   Section::::Elements.:Form in poetry.:Visual presentation.   Even before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. \nAcrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.   With the advent of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work.  Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes.  Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition.  At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.  In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.   Section::::Elements.:Diction.   Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form.  Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. \nRegisters in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.  Poetic diction can include rhetorical devices such as simile and metaphor, as well as tones of voice, such as irony.  Aristotle wrote in the \"Poetics\" that \"the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor.\"  Since the rise of Modernism, some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of tone.  On the other hand, Surrealists have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of catachresis.   Allegorical stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  \"Aesop's Fables\", repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 BCE, are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. \nOther notables examples include the \"Roman de la Rose\", a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's \"Piers Ploughman\" in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's \"Fables\" (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.   Another element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid imagery for effect.  The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and haiku.  Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor.  Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's \"rosy-fingered dawn\" or \"the wine-dark sea\") or a longer refrain.  Such repetition can add a somber tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.   Section::::Forms.   Specific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. \nIn more developed, closed or \"received\" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an elegy to the highly formalized structure of the ghazal or villanelle. Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages.  Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of the poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the glossary.   Section::::Forms.:Sonnet.   Among the most common forms of poetry, popular from the Late Middle Ages on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure.  By the 14th century and the Italian Renaissance, the form had further crystallized under the pen of Petrarch, whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by Sir Thomas Wyatt, who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.  A traditional Italian or Petrarchan sonnet follows the rhyme scheme \"ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE\", though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or \"sestet\"), is common. \nThe English (or Shakespearean) sonnet follows the rhyme scheme \"ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG\", introducing a third quatrain (grouping of four lines), a final couplet, and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use iambic pentameter, while in the Romance languages, the hendecasyllable and Alexandrine are the most widely used meters.   Sonnets of all types often make use of a \"volta\", or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated.  This \"volta\" can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines.  In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet. \n Sonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet), Michael Drayton, and Shakespeare, whose sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the \"Oxford Book of English Verse\". However, the twists and turns associated with the \"volta\" allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.  Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e.e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy).  Further, postmodern authors such as Ted Berrigan and John Berryman have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.   Section::::Forms.:Shi.   \"Shi\" ()  Is the main type of Classical Chinese poetry. \nWithin this form of poetry the most important variations are \"folk song\" styled verse (\"yuefu\"), \"old style\" verse (\"gushi\"), \"modern style\" verse (\"jintishi\"). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory.  The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular.  For the other variations of \"shi\" poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or \"jueju\") or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming.  The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a caesura before the final three syllables.  The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device. \nThe \"old style\" verse (\"Gushi\") is less formally strict than the \"jintishi\", or regulated verse, which, despite the name \"new style\" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as Shen Yue (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi'ang (661–702 CE). A good example of a poet known for his \"Gushi\" poems is Li Bai (701–762 CE).  Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese.  The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets.  The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words.  Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of allusion, and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.  One of the masters of the form was Du Fu (712–770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).   Section::::Forms.:Villanelle. \n The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme.  The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, and Elizabeth Bishop.   Section::::Forms.:Limerick.   A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous.  Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables.  However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven.  All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.   Section::::Forms.:Tanka.  Tanka is a form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, with five sections totalling 31 \"onji\" (phonological units identical to morae), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.  There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. \nTanka were written as early as the Asuka period by such poets as Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (\"fl.\" late 7th century), at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form.  Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as \"waka\"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes.  By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term \"waka\" (\"Japanese poetry\") came to be used exclusively for tanka.  Tanka are still widely written today.   Section::::Forms.:Haiku.   Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the \"hokku\", or opening verse of a renku.  Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 \"onji\", structured in a 5-7-5 pattern.  Traditionally, haiku contain a kireji, or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a kigo, or season-word.  The most famous exponent of the haiku was Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694).  An example of his writing:  Section::::Forms.:Khlong. \n The \"khlong\" (, ) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms. This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with \"mai ek\" (, , ) or \"mai tho\" (, , ).  This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the Ayutthaya Kingdom period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks.  It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form.   In \"khlong\", a stanza (\"bot\", , ) has a number of lines (\"bat\", , , from Pali and Sanskrit \"pāda\"), depending on the type.  The \"bat\" are subdivided into two \"wak\" (, , from Sanskrit \"varga\").  The first \"wak\" has five syllables, the second has a variable number, also depending on the type, and may be optional.  The type of \"khlong\" is named by the number of \"bat\" in a stanza; it may also be divided into two main types: \"khlong suphap\" (, ) and \"khlong dan\" (, ). \nThe two differ in the number of syllables in the second \"wak\" of the final \"bat\" and inter-stanza rhyming rules.  Section::::Forms.:Khlong.:Khlong si suphap.   The \"khlong si suphap\" (, ) is the most common form still currently employed.  It has four \"bat\" per stanza (\"si\" translates as \"four\").  The first \"wak\" of each \"bat\" has five syllables.  The second \"wak\" has two or four syllables in the first and third \"bat\", two syllables in the second, and four syllables in the fourth.  \"Mai ek\" is required for seven syllables and \"Mai tho\" is required for four, as shown below.  \"Dead word\" syllables are allowed in place of syllables which require \"mai ek\", and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.   Section::::Forms.:Ode.   Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace.  Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.  The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. \nThe antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure.  Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject.  The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.  Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.  Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode.  One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.   Section::::Forms.:Ghazal.   The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Bengali poetry.  In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain at the end of the second line.  This refrain may be of one or several syllables and is preceded by a rhyme.  Each line has an identical meter. \nThe ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.  As with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu.  Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form.  The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.  Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.   One of the most famous poet in this type of poetry is Hafez, whose poems often include the theme of exposing hypocrisy.  His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author.  The West-östlicher Diwan of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a collection of lyrical poems, is inspired by the Persian poet Hafez.   Section::::Genres.   In addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different genres and subgenres.  A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.  Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. \nOthers view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.  Section::::Genres.:Narrative poetry.   Narrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a story.  Broadly it subsumes epic poetry, but the term \"narrative poetry\" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to human interest.  Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry.  Many scholars of Homer have concluded that his \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" were composed of compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes.  Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English ballads, and Baltic and Slavic heroic poems—is performance poetry with roots in a preliterate oral tradition.  It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, alliteration and kennings, once served as memory aids for bards who recited traditional tales.   Notable narrative poets have included Ovid, Dante, Juan Ruiz, William Langland, Chaucer, Fernando de Rojas, Luís de Camões, Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Robert Burns, Adam Mickiewicz, Alexander Pushkin, Edgar Allan Poe, Alfred Tennyson, and Anne Carson.   Section::::Genres.:Lyric poetry.   Lyric poetry is a genre that, unlike epic and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more personal nature. \nPoems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting characters and actions, it portrays the poet's own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions.  Notable poets in this genre include Christine de Pizan, John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Antonio Machado, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.   Section::::Genres.:Epic poetry.   Epic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of narrative literature.  This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time.  It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons.  Examples of epic poems are Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", Virgil's Aeneid, the \"Nibelungenlied\", Luís de Camões' \"Os Lusíadas\", the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\", the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the \"Mahabharata\", Valmiki's \"Ramayana\", Ferdowsi's \"Shahnama\", Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the \"Epic of King Gesar\". \nWhile the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent on the basis of his epic, \"Omeros\".   Section::::Genres.:Satirical poetry.   Poetry can be a powerful vehicle for satire.  The Romans had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for political purposes.  A notable example is the Roman poet Juvenal's satires.   The same is true of the English satirical tradition.  John Dryden (a Tory), the first Poet Laureate, produced in 1682 \"Mac Flecknoe\", subtitled \"A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S.\" (a reference to Thomas Shadwell).  Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester.  Satirical poets outside England include Poland's Ignacy Krasicki, Azerbaijan's Sabir and Portugal's Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage.   Section::::Genres.:Elegy.   An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a lament for the dead or a funeral song.  The term \"elegy,\" which originally denoted a type of poetic meter (elegiac meter), commonly describes a poem of mourning. \nAn elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.   Notable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included Propertius, Jorge Manrique, Jan Kochanowski, Chidiock Tichborne, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, John Milton, Thomas Gray, Charlotte Turner Smith, William Cullen Bryant, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Evgeny Baratynsky, Alfred Tennyson, Walt Whitman, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Giannina Braschi, William Butler Yeats, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Virginia Woolf.   Section::::Genres.:Verse fable.   The fable is an ancient literary genre, often (though not invariably) set in verse.  It is a succinct story that features anthropomorphized animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a \"moral\").  Verse fables have used a variety of meter and rhyme patterns.   Notable verse fabulists have included Aesop, Vishnu Sarma, Phaedrus, Marie de France, Robert Henryson, Biernat of Lublin, Jean de La Fontaine, Ignacy Krasicki, Félix María de Samaniego, Tomás de Iriarte, Ivan Krylov and Ambrose Bierce.   Section::::Genres.:Dramatic poetry. \n Dramatic poetry is drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the \"bianwen\" verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera.  East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh.  Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, \"Layla and Majnun\" and \"Khosrow and Shirin\", Ferdowsi's tragedies such as \"Rostam and Sohrab\", Rumi's \"Masnavi\", Gorgani's tragedy of \"Vis and Ramin\", and Vahshi's tragedy of \"Farhad\".   Section::::Genres.:Speculative poetry.   Speculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major sub-classification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are \"beyond reality\", whether via extrapolation as in science fiction or via weird and horrific themes as in horror fiction.  Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines.  Edgar Allan Poe is sometimes seen as the \"father of speculative poetry\". \nPoe's most remarkable achievement in the genre was his anticipation, by three-quarters of a century, of the Big Bang theory of the universe's origin, in his then much-derided 1848 essay (which, due to its very speculative nature, he termed a \"prose poem\"), \"\".  Section::::Genres.:Prose poetry.   Prose poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry.  It may be indistinguishable from the micro-story ( the \"short short story\", \"flash fiction\").  While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included Aloysius Bertrand, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé.  Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as \"The Prose Poem: An International Journal\", \"Contemporary Haibun Online\", and \"Haibun Today\" devoted to that genre and its hybrids.  Latin American poets of the 20th century who wrote prose poems include Octavio Paz and Giannina Braschi  Section::::Genres.:Light poetry.   Light poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous. \nPoems considered \"light\" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature word play, including puns, adventurous rhyme and heavy alliteration. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English usually obeys at least some formal conventions.  Common forms include the limerick, the clerihew, and the double dactyl.   While light poetry is sometimes condemned as doggerel, or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way.  Many of the most renowned \"serious\" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include Lewis Carroll, Ogden Nash, X. J. Kennedy, Willard R. Espy, and Wendy Cope.   Section::::Genres.:Slam poetry.   Slam poetry is a genre, that originated in 1986 in Chicago, Illinois, when Marc Kelly Smith organized the first slam.   Slam performers comment emotively, aloud before an audience, on personal, social, or other matters.  It focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation, and voice inflection.  Slam poetry is often competitive, at dedicated \"poetry slam\" contests.

{"id":"KILT_59990826","text":" CRISPR gene editing  CRISPR gene editing is a method by which the genomes of living organisms may be edited.  It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial CRISPR/Cas (CRISPR-Cas9) antiviral defense system.  By delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added.  The Cas9-gRNA complex corresponds with the CAS III CRISPR-RNA complex in the accompanying diagram.   While genomic editing in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed had proved to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a larger scale.  Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the gene.  Working like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of DNA to introduce the modification by one of two methods.  Knock-in mutations, facilitated via Homology Directed Repair (HDR), is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.  This allows for the introduction of targeted DNA damage and repair.  HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template. \nThis method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for a repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by Cas9/CRISPR results in the repair of the double-strand break by means of NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining).  NHEJ can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site disrupting or altering gene functionality.  Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR-Cas9 allows researchers the ability to generate targeted random gene disruption.   Because of this, the precision of genomic editing is a great concern.  With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing is now a reality.  Cas9 allows for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRna guide strands.  Cas9 derived from \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" bacteria has facilitated the targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells.  The ease with which researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to silence or cause point mutations on specific loci has proved invaluable to the quick and efficient mapping of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes.  Newly engineered variants of the Cas9 nuclease have been developed that significantly reduce off-target activity. \n CRISPR-Cas genome editing techniques have many potential applications, including medicine and crop seed enhancement. The use of CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA complex for genome editing was the AAAS's choice for breakthrough of the year in 2015.  Bioethical concerns have been raised about the prospect of using CRISPR for germline editing.   Section::::Predecessors.   In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points.  In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand.  Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs.  CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.   Whereas RNA interference (RNAi) does not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, ZFNs and TALENs provide full irreversible gene knockout.  CRISPR can also target several DNA sites simultaneously by simply introducing different gRNAs.  In addition, CRISPR costs are relatively low.   Section::::Genome engineering. \n CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).   Section::::Genome engineering.:Major components.   CRISPR-Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells.  The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table.  The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA.  The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired.  The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.   Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).  This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.   Section::::Genome engineering.:Structure.   CRISPR-Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction.  It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. \nThe target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array. A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences.  Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA.  The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.   The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9.  Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence.  However this is not too limiting as it is a short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).   Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.   Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break.  Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. \nThe repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break. The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome.  Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.   Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.   Section::::Genome engineering.:Delivery.   Delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems.  Electroporation of DNA, RNA, or ribonucleocomplexes is a common technique, though it can result in harmful effects on the target cells.  Chemical transfection techniques utilizing lipids have also been used to introduce sgRNA in complex with Cas9 into cells.  Hard-to-transfect cells (e.g. stem cells, neurons, and hematopoietic cells) require more efficient delivery systems such as those based on lentivirus (LVs), adenovirus (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV).   Section::::Genome engineering.:Controlled genome editing.   Several variants of CRISPR-Cas9 allow gene activation or genome editing with an external trigger such as light or small molecules. \nThese include photoactivatable CRISPR systems developed by fusing light-responsive protein partners with an activator domain and a dCas9 for gene activation, or fusing similar light responsive domains with two constructs of split-Cas9, or by incorporating caged unnatural amino acids into Cas9, or by modifying the guide RNAs with photocleavable complements for genome editing.  Methods to control genome editing with small molecules include an allosteric Cas9, with no detectable background editing, that will activate binding and cleavage upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), 4-HT responsive intein-linked Cas9s or a Cas9 that is 4-HT responsive when fused to four ERT2 domains.  Intein-inducible split-Cas9 allows dimerization of Cas9 fragments and Rapamycin-inducible split-Cas9 system developed by fusing two constructs of split Cas9 with FRB and FKBP fragments.  Furthermore, other studies have shown to induce transcription of Cas9 with a small molecule, doxycycline.  Small molecules can also be used to improve Homology Directed Repair (HDR), often by inhibiting the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway.  These systems allow conditional control of CRISPR activity for improved precision, efficiency and spatiotemporal control.   Section::::Applications.   Section::::Applications.:Disease models.   Cas9 genomic modification has allowed for the quick and efficient generation of transgenic models within the field of genetics. \nCas9 can be easily introduced into the target cells via plasmid transfection along with sgRNA in order to model the spread of diseases and the cell's response and defense to infection. The ability of Cas9 to be introduced in vivo allows for the creation of more accurate models of gene function, mutation effects, all while avoiding the off-target mutations typically observed with older methods of genetic engineering.  The CRISPR and Cas9 revolution in genomic modeling doesn't only extend to mammals.  Traditional genomic models such as \"Drosophila melanogaster,\" one of the first model species, have seen further refinement in their resolution with the use of Cas9.  Cas9 uses cell-specific promoters allowing a controlled use of the Cas9.  Cas9 is an accurate method of treating diseases due to the targeting of the Cas9 enzyme only affecting certain cell types.  The cells undergoing the Cas9 therapy can also be removed and reintroduced to provide amplified effects of the therapy.   CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms \"in vivo\" and entire chromosomes can be eliminated from an organism at any point in its development.  Chromosomes that have been deleted \"in vivo\" are the Y chromosomes and X chromosomes of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and aneuploid mice respectively. \nThis method might be useful for treating genetic aneuploid diseases such as Down Syndrome and intersex disorders.  Successful \"in vivo\" genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has been shown in several model organisms, such as \"Escherichia coli\", \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", \"Candida albicans\", \"Caenorhadbitis elegans\", \"Arabidopsis\", \"Danio rerio\", \"Mus musculus\".  Successes have been achieved in the study of basic biology, in the creation of disease models, and in the experimental treatment of disease models.   Concerns have been raised that off-target effects (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may obscure the results of a CRISPR gene editing experiment (the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).  Modifications to CRISPR have been made to minimize the possibility of off-target effects.  In addition, orthogonal CRISPR experiments are recommended to confirm the results of a gene editing experiment.   CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated.  CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be targeted at non-germline cells. \n CRISPR can be utilized to create human cellular models of disease. For instance, applied to human pluripotent stem cells CRISPR introduced targeted mutations in genes relevant to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids that exhibited disease-specific phenotypes.  Kidney organoids from stem cells with PKD mutations formed large, translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules.  The cysts were capable of reaching macroscopic dimensions, up to one centimeter in diameter.  Kidney organoids with mutations in a gene linked to FSGS developed junctional defects between podocytes, the filtering cells affected in that disease.  This was traced to the inability of podocytes ability to form microvilli between adjacent cells.  Importantly, these disease phenotypes were absent in control organoids of identical genetic background, but lacking the CRISPR modifications.   A similar approach was taken to model long QT syndrome in cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells.  These CRISPR-generated cellular models, with isogenic controls, provide a new way to study human disease and test drugs.   Section::::Applications.:Biomedicine.  CRISPR-Cas technology has been proposed as a treatment for multiple human diseases, especially those with a genetic cause.  Its ability to modify specific DNA sequences makes it a tool with potential to fix disease-causing mutations. \nEarly research in animal models suggest that therapies based on CRISPR technology have potential to treat a wide range of diseases, including cancer, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, Huntington's, and heart disease. CRISPR may have applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, such as by creating human blood vessels that lack expression of MHC class II proteins, which often cause transplant rejection.   Section::::Applications.:Biomedicine.:CRISPR in the treatment of infection.   CRISPR-Cas-based \"RNA-guided nucleases\" can be used to target virulence factors, genes encoding antibiotic resistance and other medically relevant sequences of interest.  This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations.  Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR-Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as transposons, bacteriophages and plasmids.  This system was shown to be a strong selective pressure for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence factor in bacterial pathogens.    Therapies based on CRISPR–Cas3 gene editing technology delivered by engineered bacteriophages could be used to destroy targeted DNA in pathogens. \nCas3 is more destructive than the better known Cas9  Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple herpesviruses. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  Anti  -herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for immunocompromised patients of viral invaders, or preventing cold sore outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking HSV-1 reactivation.  , these were awaiting testing.    CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people.  Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients.  In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirus's DNA from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.  Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.   Section::::Applications.:Biomedicine.:CRISPR and cancer.    CRISPR had been studied in animal models and cancer cell lines, to learn if it can be used to repair or thwart mutated genes that cause cancer.   The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016.  It involved removing immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. \n20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, .  In 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.   Section::::Applications.:Knockdown/activation.   Using \"dead\" versions of Cas9 (dCas9) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences.  Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity.  Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site.  The targeted site is methylated, epigenetically modifying the gene.  This modification inhibits transcription.  These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA.  Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.  Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription. \nCas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level. In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription.  For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added.  Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called promoters that immediately precede the target gene.   Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors that activated specific human genes.  The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.   Section::::Applications.:RNA editing.   In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit RNA.  The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes.  They considered the fusobacteria \"Leptotrichia shahii\".  It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences.  When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.   Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses.  HIV and poliovirus are such viruses.  Bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus.  Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing. \n CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of micro-RNA and long-noncoding RNA genes in plants.  Section::::Applications.:Gene drive.   Gene drives may provide a powerful tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species.  Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as non-target species have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild.  Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental gene drives including molecular, reproductive, and ecological.  Many recommend that immunization and reversal drives be developed in tandem with gene drives in order to overwrite their effects if necessary.  There remains consensus that long-term effects must be studied more thoroughly particularly in the potential for ecological disruption that cannot be corrected with reversal drives.   Section::::Applications.:\"In vitro\" genetic depletion.   Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences.  Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes.  Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.   Section::::Patents and commercialization. \n , SAGE Labs (part of Horizon Discovery group) had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models. , Thermo Fisher Scientific had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits.   , patent rights to CRISPR were contested.  Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools.  As companies ramp up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR can be quickly monetized were raised.  In February 2017 the US Patent Office ruled on a patent interference case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the Broad Institute, and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California.   Shortly after, University of California filed an appeal of this ruling.   In March 2017, the European Patent Office (EPO) announced its intention to allow broad claims for editing all kinds of cells to Max-Planck Institute in Berlin, University of California, and University of Vienna, and in August 2017, the EPO announced its intention to allow CRISPR claims in a patent application that MilliporeSigma had filed. \nthe patent situation in Europe was complex, with MilliporeSigma, ToolGen, Vilnius University, and Harvard contending for claims, along with University of California and Broad.  Section::::Society and culture.   Section::::Society and culture.:Human germline modification.   As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research with the intention of laying the foundations for applying CRISPR to human embryos for human germline engineering, including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company OvaScience.  Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use.  They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".  These scientists support further low-level research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making heritable changes to humans.   In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.  The study had previously been rejected by both \"Nature\" and \"Science\" in part because of ethical concerns. \nThe experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine.  In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the CCR5 gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.   In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore.  Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification.  They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines.  A specific distinction was made between somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by descendants.  Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism).  Altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible.  The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries. \n In November 2018, Jiankui He announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for CCR5, which codes for a receptor that HIV uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier.  He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 (mosaicism) and were still vulnerable to HIV.  The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.  An international group of scientists called for a global moratorium on genetically editing human embryos.   Section::::Society and culture.:Policy barriers to genetic engineering.   Policy regulations for the CRISPR-Cas9 system vary around the globe.  In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify human embryos by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques.  However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.   The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops.  For example, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 gives the USDA the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. \nThe act regulates any genetically modified organism that utilizes the genome of a predefined \"plant pest\" or any plant not previously categorized. In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom, to make them non-browning.  Since he had not added any foreign-species (transgenic) DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated by the USDA under Section 340.2.  Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the CRISPR-Cas9 protein system to pass US regulation.  In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques.  With the help of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next five years and any new regulations that might be needed as a result.  The FDA in 2017 proposed a rule that would classify genetic engineering modifications to animals as \"animal drugs\", subjecting them to strict regulation if offered for sale, and reducing the ability for individuals and small businesses to make them profitably.   In China, where social conditions sharply contrast with the west, genetic diseases carry a heavy stigma.  This leaves China with fewer policy barriers to the use of this technology. \n Section::::Society and culture.:Recognition.  In 2012, and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in \"Science Magazine\"'s Breakthrough of the Year award.  In 2015, it was the winner of that award.  CRISPR was named as one of \"MIT Technology Review\"s 10 breakthrough technologies in 2014 and 2016.  In 2016, Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, along with Rudolph Barrangou, Philippe Horvath, and Feng Zhang won the Gairdner International award.  In 2017, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were awarded the Japan Prize for their revolutionary invention of CRISPR-Cas9 in Tokyo, Japan.  In 2016, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Jennifer Doudna, and Feng Zhang won the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science.   Section::::See also.

{"id":"KILT_1845197","text":" Lethbridge Collegiate Institute  Lethbridge Collegiate Institute (LCI) is a public high school in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, operated by Lethbridge School District No. 51 that serves grades nine through twelve.  LCI was the first school in Lethbridge designated only for secondary students.  It opened at its current location in 1950, but was founded in a smaller, adjacent building in 1928.  Since its 1950 opening, several additions and layout changes have been made at the school.  In August 2010, Chinook High School opened in West Lethbridge with over 700 students enrolled.  Those that entered grade 11 in 2009 at LCI were permitted to complete their graduating year at LCI, but west Lethbridge students are now encouraged to attend the new high school, which was being built in conjunction with a western campus of Catholic Central High School, recreational facilities, and a public library.   As a result of Chinook's opening, LCI's enrollment decreased by a substantial 35% for the 2010–2011 school year and a further 11% to only 870 in 2011-2012; less than both Chinook and north Lethbridge's Winston Churchill High.   A relatively extensive academic program is offered, including automotives, construction and communication technology, fashion studies, and four language studies programs. \nAn Advanced Placement Program is offered in several key subject areas, including mathematics, language arts, and the sciences. Respected instrumental music, choir, and dance programs have helped LCI become well known in Southern Alberta for offering balanced opportunities to students in both academics and extracurricular activities.  Athletic teams from LCI carry the names Rams, Clippers, Colts, and Schooners, although the latter two have fallen into disuse.   Section::::History.   Section::::History.:Early years.   In the early 1900s, two schools near downtown Lethbridge were named with reference to their location.  Built in 1891, fifteen years prior to the incorporation of the City of Lethbridge, the first was Central School.  The small school was the only one that served secondary students in the Lethbridge area.  In 1909, Central School closed and secondary education classes moved into a vacated building on 5 Avenue.  The school became too crowded in the mid-1920s, and a struggle began between the school board and the city to have a new school constructed.   In February 1928, construction work began on Lethbridge Collegiate Institute at the corner of 4 Avenue and 15 Street South.  The institution would become the city's first combined junior high and high school. \nThe site had previously been used for aviation activities in the city, until the opening of Kenyon Field (now Lethbridge County Airport) south of Six-Mile Coulee in the summer of 1939. Construction of the school at the site finished in October 1928, but a fire in the spring of 1929 ravaged the new building.  Classes had to be moved to other local schools until later that year.   When LCI became too small for the city's growing population in 1950, a new building was constructed on the same block just east of the old one.  Due to southern Alberta's booming population, twenty-one schools were constructed in Lethbridge between 1946 and 1965.  Grades 10–12 were moved to the new building while grades 7–9 remained at their present location.  The new junior high was renamed Lethbridge Junior High School, but kept the name for less than a year.  In the latter part of 1950, the junior high adopted its new name, Hamilton Junior High School (named after a former teacher, principal, and superintendent, William Alfred Hamilton).  The school kept the name for over half a century until its relocation to the rapidly expanding area of West Lethbridge as G.S. Lakie Middle School in 2003.   Next door, classes commenced on November 22, 1950 at the new LCI. \nWith increases in student population, new sections of the building were added in 1955, 1957, 1970, and 1986. Today, a section of Hamilton's old building houses Allan Watson High School.  While the high school is not operated by district 51, the building is also being renovated to house the headquarters of Lethbridge School District 51.   Section::::History.:A new grade.   In accordance with a grade reconfiguration in many public schools across Alberta, Grade 9 students began attending the school in the fall of 2003.  Teachers, textbooks, and other classroom materials were brought in from local middle schools.  The changes introduced a new term to the area: \"middle school\".  With the middle school enrolling students for grades 6–8, the term \"high school\" was redefined to include grades 9–12.  The changes created minor inconveniences for staff and other areas of the school.  At LCI, it brought more students into a building already near capacity.   Community members believed the restructuring by the government was targeted specifically at the City of Lethbridge, a move made to force the province to build an additional Lethbridge high school.  Such a project had been anticipated for at least a decade.  As expected, the announcement for the new school came in 2005.  Enrollment at LCI exceeded 1,600 students. \nIn an effort to reduce numbers, students living on the City's north side who attend LCI must be enrolled in a course not offered at Winston Churchill High School.  LCI's enrollment peaked in 2005.  The population of the city has steadily increased.  The graduating class of 2007 was the first to complete all four years of learning at the school since its founding.  The convocation in May, with the day's ceremonies at the ENMAX Centre, was centred around the a theme noting the historical fact that it was the first class to spend all four years of their secondary education at LCl.   Section::::History.:December 2007 shooting scare.   On December 13, 2007, a note was found handwritten in a washroom stall.   Its exact words were undisclosed, but school officials described it as \"a student's intention to shoot others, as well as possibly taking their own life, on December 20.\"  A district official responded, \"at this point in time we're not planning to install metal detectors.  We feel that we're taking the precautions by having a police presence.\"  Extra staff members and local police officers patrolled the school's hallways for the week of December 17–21. \nOnly days earlier, the words \"December 18, 2007 \" were found in a washroom at Paul Kane High School in St. Albert, Alberta. Officials at that school said \"extraordinary security measures\" were to be taken, but it was believed to be a hoax.  It is unknown if the LCI incident was simply a copycat of the Paul Kane incident, but school officials in both cities requested that the perpetrators step forward; neither has done so.  Both schools also made counseling staff available for any students who felt apprehensive about their safety.   On December 20, a similar note was found in a bathroom at W. R. Myers High School in nearby Taber, Alberta, indicating a student's intent to do harm on December 21.  With a student attendance of roughly 20%, classes proceeded without incident.  In 1999, a student opened fire at W. R. Myers, killing one student and seriously wounding another.  In 2000, LCI was locked down after two youths were arrested and two firearms were seized.   Section::::Campus.  LCI is a maze of hallways that is split into different wings where various subjects are taught.  The school building is land-locked and bounded by surrounding buildings.  Victoria Park High School resides to the west of LCI.  Businesses are to the north of the school. \nA church and residential homes are across the street to the south of the LCI building. The Catholic Central High School is across the street to the east.   The current layout has the campus divided into sections, seven of which are in the main building.  The \"A\" wing, with the cafeteria, music rooms, and a small, secondary gymnasium, is the westernmost portion of the building.  The \"B\" wing, a newer component of the building, contains mostly the English and Mathematics departments.  The bottom floor of the large, southern \"C\" wing holds the library and two lecture theatres.  The upper floors contain computer, biology, chemistry, and physics laboratories as well as several classrooms.  The main \"D\" wing contains administrator offices, science, and social studies classrooms.  The main gym and counselling department technically make up the \"E\" wing, though it is hardly referred to by that name.  Construction technology, automotives, and the LCI Performing Arts Centre north of the main gym are the \"F\" wing, while a small, third floor section containing home economics is the \"H\" wing.  Underneath the home economics area is a fitness centre housing various exercise equipment. \nThe single-storey, peripheral \"G\" wing, a linear building separated by a 15-metre lane from the main building, houses a communication technology lab, electronic equipment, autobody, and an art room. The total floor area at LCI exceeds that of all the other schools in the district combined.   A concession booth close to the main gymnasium provides various snacks that can be purchased during the day and at evening sporting events.  The cafeteria at the west end of the building sells food for lunch.  Students are also free to leave the campus for lunch as several fast food restaurants are within walking distance.  In another effort to reduce congestion, LCI lunch period is almost entirely offset from that of nearby Catholic Central High School.  The school also has problems with internal overcrowding.  Hundreds of students are bussed from the city's west side daily.   A lane north of the school is restricted to buses only.  Students traverse the staff parking lot in the morning and afternoon to reach 13 busses, the majority of which carry students to and from West Lethbridge.  Although a parking lot for staff with over 100 parking spaces is provided, no parking is officially designated for students. \nCompeting with students from the other two area high schools also trying to park their vehicles, Lethbridge students must park their vehicles on 5 Avenue, or south on 17 Street or 18 Street.  Packed on two city blocks with five other schools, the surrounding narrow streets are difficult to navigate for parents and students with cars during the morning and afternoon rush.   Section::::Academics.   From Monday to Thursday, the school operates from 7:55 in the morning to 3:00 in the afternoon with 77 minute classes.  Grade ten, eleven and twelve students have four different modules with one doubled on each day of the week (e.g. module 3 is doubled on Wednesday).  On Fridays, classes begin slightly later, running from 7:55 to 12:38 with four 62 minute classes and no lunch period.  From Monday to Thursday, the lunch period begins at 11:49.  The peculiar times are partly due to the district's school busses, which are also needed for elementary and middle schools which have later start and end times.   In preparation for Provincial Achievement Tests (PATs) at the end of the year, grade nine students operate on a similar system to that of the local middle schools.  All courses run from September until June with the exception of option courses which are semestered. \nThis is contrary to grades ten through twelve, where nearly all classes are semester long and students receive 5 credits per course. 100 credits are needed to graduate, per Alberta Learning requirements.  Each credit signifies approximately 125 hours of classroom instruction.  Of their final sixteen high school modules (4 in grade eleven and 4 in grade twelve), students are permitted to take three spare modules with a general restriction of one per year in grade eleven and one per semester in grade twelve.   Due to the high enrollment, several teachers have had their classrooms segregated from their main department.  In recent years, the teachers were left without classrooms and had to make use of whatever rooms were available during a particular module.  As a result, the building is now much less departmentalized than was originally planned.   Numerous scholarships are offered annually for students.  For some students, applying for a scholarship is not necessary; grade 11 or 12 students with an overall average above 80% are eligible to receive $400 via Rutherford Scholarships.  Entry into the National Honor Society is also offered to them, requiring students to complete a minimum of 10 hours community service over the course of the year.  The Society participates in directing annual functions such as \"Parent-Teacher Evening\". \nIn the community, the group assists at the Chinook Regional Hospital and at Salvation Army functions, such as bell ringing.  LCI students are encouraged to remain within the city for their post-secondary students and attend the University of Lethbridge by representatives from that school.  Accordingly, it is easier for local students to be rewarded with scholarships, and several are only available for students who attended high school in Southern Alberta.  A high number of students also go on to attend the Universities of Calgary and Alberta, as well as Lethbridge College.  In a 2009 Fraser Institute report, which was conducted from the previous school year, LCI was ranked 162nd among Alberta high school schools, down significantly from a rank of 102nd in the previous 5 years.  More promising is the fact that the number of students dropping out of school before completion has steadily decreased, on average, provincewide.  While data is not available for individual institutions, the number of students completing school has also increased districtwide.   Section::::Academics.:Advisor Program.   Similar to a long-running program in place at Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was introduced in the fall of 2006. \nThe program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they were randomly assigned at the beginning of the year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult.  Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions.  Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents.  Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor.  In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.   Section::::Academics.:Student council.   The Student Council consists of a president, four vice presidents (one elected from each grade), a secretary, a treasurer, a Spirit Coordinator, and an Activity Coordinator.  Members of the council perform administrative duties such as the organization of assemblies and school functions.  The vice presidential positions are intended to provide student representation with a closer connection to the administration within respective grades, but they have been criticised for being simply symbolic.   The budget designated to the council is low.  The activities, for which members through their campaign promises were initially voted to organize, seldom happen. \nThe president, with help from other council members, will normally \"emcee\" pep rallies geared toward increasing school spirit and promoting the fine arts. Until 2006, elections for all positions were held in late September or early October.  Now, elections for all positions (except for the grade nine vice-president) are held in June for the elected to take office in the following year.   Section::::Academics.:Advanced Placement Program.   The Advanced Placement Program (AP) at LCI was a program highly promoted at feeder schools, locally compared to the International Baccalaureate program (IB) offered at Winston Churchill.  Advanced Placement classes are no longer offered at the school.  In grade 8 classes at middle school, students had to achieve a final average above 80% to enter AP classes in grade 9.  The program was intended to give students an opportunity to learn in subjects beyond the basic curriculum.  Some graduates of the AP program have stated that the material learned was similar to first-year university courses.  The program consists of advanced courses in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, English, and social studies.   More extracurricular activities and \"more peaceful\" classrooms are among the praises for the program. \nHowever, for the majority of the courses, little to no extra work is completed in the advanced stream versus the regular courses. Unlike the IB program, Alberta Learning states that students may not switch between the lowest streams and Advanced Placement in grades 11 and 12; but they can switch between the various streams in grades 9 and 10.  Both AP and IB programs are presented based on their different strengths and weaknesses, and students are encouraged to select their high school based on other factors such as their location in Lethbridge.  Annually, LCI students take provincial advanced placement exams in various subjects, including World History, literature and physics, in grade 12.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.   The main gymnasium has a large \"Wall of Champions\" along the east and south wall, timelining provincial athletic victories since the move to the new building.  Several hallways are lined with framed photographs of past LCI athletic teams, choirs, and councils that date back to the early 1980s.  The \"L.C.I. Wall of Distinction\" profiles dozens of notable graduates.  Two or three members are inducted each year in a prominent school assembly, usually with the inductees, as well as the city's mayor, in attendance.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Athletics.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Athletics.:Football. \n LCI has an active Canadian football program that regularly produces future Canadian Football League as well as Division I players in the United States. The latest is Jon Gott, a 2004 graduate who went on to Boise State University.  In 2008, the LCI football team did an exchange with Crestwood High School in Peterborough, Ontario.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Athletics.:Other sports.   With several members winning various awards at provincial competitions, the 2006–07 year was promising for the LCI wrestling team.   Elsewhere, a former LCI student and rugby union player, Ashley Patzer, was named CIS player of the year for 2006.  She was also later named the University of Lethbridge Female Athlete of the Year.  As of 2007, track and field, baseball, basketball, badminton, curling, golf, softball, volleyball, and girls slowpitch are also played at LCI.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Athletics.:School song.   The song is no longer used or promoted at school athletic events, mostly because of the elimination of cheerleading several years ago.  Nonetheless, the song is as follows (sung to the tune of \"Anchors Aweigh\"):  Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Choir.   The choral program at LCI is prominent, and is arguably the school's most successful extracurricular program.  Choir is provided as an optional course at all grades. \nAuditions are also held annually for the school's three representative choirs:  BULLET::::- The Chamber Choir is the program's star feature and most well-known group, directed by Karen Hudson. The group consists of around 40 young vocalists of extreme musical talent.  The majority of their music is spiritual, but they are also known for adding music from various international languages.  Near the end of every school year, the choir, through various fundraising efforts over the course of the year, takes an international trip.  At the 2006 MusicFest Canada competition in Ottawa, Ontario, the Chamber and Jazz choirs received gold awards in the choral/vocal jazz division.  Past trips include visits to Japan, New York City and Hawaii.  As they do every few years, the choir traveled overseas in April 2007, touring and performing in Western Europe.  The 08-09 year was a special one, with the group traveling to New York City where they performed in the historic Carnegie Hall, singing repertoire from Mozart's Coronation Mass, as well as traveling to Italy to perform at St. Peter's Basilica under the direction of famed choral composer Z. Randall Stroope.  The group has also been successful at various local, provincial, and national music festivals. \n BULLET::::- The Jazz Choir, also led by Hudson, consists of 12 students, all of whom are members of the Chamber Choir. They are an a cappella group.  Their songs range from ballads to almost rock-style jazz.  The choir performs at the aforementioned Christmas and spring concerts as well as various community events throughout the year and occasionally with local artists.   BULLET::::- The \"LCI Singers\" consist of girls from grades 9–12, led by Karen Hudson.  They perform primarily at school functions such as Remembrance Day and charity venues such as Compassion Canada to help raise money to aid new mothers in Africa.  In May 2005, the group traveled to Edmonton and performed for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  LCI Singers usually take one major trip each year, using several concerts throughout the school year as fundraisers.  In April 2007 they traveled to England and Wales on a performing tour.  In May 2008 they placed first in the Provincial competition for their class.  The group has also received second place in the 2014 and 2015 provincial festivals.  In 2017, the group received second place at the National Music Festival.  In April 2009, the LCI Singers went on their second European tour to Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic. \n BULLET::::- The LCI Concert Choir is the school’s non-audition, option choir that consists of men and women from grades 9 to 12. This choir is split into 2 separate classes, the Grade 9 Class Choir and the Grade 10-12 Class Choir, who rehearse once a day during a class period.  This group performs at school events such as the yearly concerts and the local music festival.   Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Clubs.   The school has provisions for over 30 clubs.  The most prominent of those that are active are 'Students Alive', 'Peer Support', the ‘Gay Straight Alliance’, and 'Travel Club'; the latter of which will travel to Italy in 2019.  Also notable is a group called the Association to Kill Apathy (AKA), which does community as well as environmental work.  On Remembrance Day of 2006, the group dedicated \"peace poles\", in association with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, garnering local media attention.   The \"Collegian Column\" is a weekly school bulletin produced by faculty, which appeals primarily to older students interested in scholarship information.  The \"LCI Journal\", the school newspaper, has not been active for a number of years. \nConcerning defunct clubs and media, the school leaves it to faculty to decide if a project is to be revived, pending student interest.  Section::::Extracurricular activities.:Other activities.   LCI has its own small theatre, which had previously been a metal shop.  The room has a sound system and some theatrical lighting; it also seats nearly 100 people.  There is a fall theatrical production performed entirely by students at the Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre, located a few blocks to the west of the school.  LCI has won several competitions in the local spring high school one act competition.   LCI is well known for its student exchange programs.  The most advertised is the exchange Japan; LCI regularly exchanges students with Sapporo Commercial High School, an institution which has also been informally twinned with LCI in a program implemented by Alberta Education.  LCI students made the trip to Japan in early July 2007.  In the 2006/07 year, the school also took part in an exchange program with a high school in Spain; several Spanish students arrived in the fall of 2006, and several LCI students departed for Spain in the spring of 2007.   The LCI dance program is rapidly expanding and features numerous styles, including jazz, modern, and hip hop.  All programs are under the direction of Georden Olsen. \nUsually, sometimes several times a semester, professional dancers and choreographers from Calgary are offered residency to work at the school for as long as three weeks. The program's feature event, \"Summerdance\", is held in the spring at the Yates Memorial Centre.   In early April 2007, a group of LCI students travelled to Vimy Ridge with students from Winston Churchill and more than 3,600 students from across Canada.  All of the students participate in events dedicated to the ninetieth anniversary of Canadian military victory during World War I.  Section::::Notable alumni.
