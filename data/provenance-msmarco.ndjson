Even some of those who are concerned about climate change occasionally highlight opportunities that it presents, whether that's a boost to UK tourism or a shake-up of global politics.  Certainly it's true that a warmer world could benefit certain people, species, regions and industries – at least for a period.

Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.

Realizing that greenhouse emissions remain in the atmosphere for a very long time, this principle recognizes that historically: Industrialized nations have emitted far more greenhouse gas emissions (even if some developing nations are only now increasing theirs); Rich countries therefore face the biggest responsibility and burden for action to address climate change; and Rich countries therefore must support developing nations adapt—through financing and technology transfer, for example.  This notion of climate justice is typically ignored by many rich nations and their mainstream media, making it easy to blame China, India and other developing countries for failures in climate change mitigation negotiations.  Development expert, Martin Khor, calculated that taking historical emissions into account, the rich countries owe a carbon debt because they have already used more than their fair quota of emissions.

{"id":"MARCO_08_339400141-2","text":"Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.

Once the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.  In some ecosystems, maximum daily temperatures might climb beyond the tolerance of indigenous plant or animal.  To survive the extreme temperatures, both marine and land-based plants and animals have started to migrate towards the poles.  Those species, and in some cases, entire ecosystems, that cannot quickly migrate or adapt, face extinction.  The IPCC estimates that 20-30 percent of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction if temperatures climb more than 1.5° to 2.5°C.  Impacting People The changes to weather and ecosystems will also affect people more directly.  Hardest hit will be those living in low-lying coastal areas, and residents of poorer countries who do not have the resources to adapt to changes in temperature extremes and water resources.

Public finance is especially vital for activities where it is difficult to attract private investment, such as adaptation, which has historically lagged behind mitigation in terms of funding.

The oceans are also an important storage (sequestering) location for carbon.  Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels introduce more carbon into the atmosphere which is taken up by the oceans and, in turn, makes the water more acidic.  The disruption of this delicate balance in the carbon cycle will in time, reduce the amount of carbon the oceans are capable of sequestering.  The image above shows the carbon cycle on Earth.

As Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology behind it, remains quite new and in the early stages of its evolution, authorities are still trying to get to grips with what exactly the technology is before attempting to come up with a plan about how to deal with it, especially in relation to taxation and money laundering issues.  Currently, there is no uniform international approach to Bitcoin and its legality will depend on where in the world that you reside.  However, as authorities gain more experience and knowledge about Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency industry in general, it is likely that at least a certain minimum levels of regulation will come into place in the vast majority of countries.  In addition, the huge gains being made by the cryptocurrency this year has meant that authorities are feeling that urgency about regulating the sector, with over 30 global regulators having announced various approaches to cryptocurrency regulation in recent months.

Combustion powers both propulsion systems, but the fuels and oxidizers are different.  Steam clouds, the product of the SLS main engines’ hydrogen-oxygen reaction, pour from an RS-25 engine during testing at NASA’s Stennis Space Center.  The RS-25 main engines are called “liquid engines” because the fuel is liquid hydrogen (LH2).  Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer.  The boosters, on the other hand, use aluminum as fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, mixed with a binder that creates one homogenous solid propellant.  Making water makes SLS fly Hydrogen, the fuel for the main engines, is the lightest element and normally exists as a gas.  Gases – especially lightweight hydrogen – are low-density, which means a little of it takes up a lot of space.

The search engine market is very one sided with just a couple companies controlling the entire market.  “ Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider’s domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias .”  -Wikipedia  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries. ","title":"What is Search Neutrality?

The book addresses the relationship between search engines and discriminatory biases.  Noble argues that search algorithms are racist and perpetuate societal problems because they reflect the negative biases that exist in society and the people who create them.  Noble dismantles the idea that search engines are inherently neutral by explaining how algorithms in search engines privilege whiteness by depicting positive cues when key words like “white” are searched as opposed to “asian,” “hispanic,” or “Black.” ","title":"Algorithms of Oppression - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_of_Oppression"}

Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender.  Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles.  Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.

Noble also adds that as a society we must have a feminist lens, with racial awareness to understand the “problematic positions about the benign instrumentality of technologies.”  Noble also discusses how Google can remove the human curation from the first page of results to eliminate any potential racial slurs or inappropriate imaging.  Another example discussed in this text is a public dispute of the results that were returned when “Jew” was searched on Google.  The results included a number of anti-Semitic pages and Google claimed little ownership for the way it provided these identities.  Google instead encouraged people to use “Jews” or “Jewish people” and claimed the actions of White supremacist groups are out of Google’s control.  Unless pages are unlawful, Google will allow its algorithm to continue to act without removing pages.

The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber.  The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries.  An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor.  The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent it from overheating.  The electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps.  This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.  An electric cycle engine uses electric pumps to pressurize the propellants from a low-pressure fuel tank to high-pressure combustion chamber levels, generally from 0.2 to 0.3 MPa (29 to 44 psi) to 10 to 20 MPa (1,500 to 2,900 psi).  The pumps are powered by an electric motor, with electricity from a battery bank. \nElectrical pumps had been used in the secondary propulsion system of the Agena upper stage vehicle. As of December 2020, the only rocket engines to use electric propellant pump systems are the Rutherford engine, nine of which power the Electron rocket, and the Delphin engine, five of which power the first stage of Astra Space 's Rocket 3.  On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.  In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded.  Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling.  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle .  There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.  The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine. \nThis is seen in the F-1 and Merlin 1D Vacuum rocket engines used on the Saturn V booster stage and the Falcon 9 second stage, respectively. As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).  The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.  Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.  Engines using this system are mechanically simple, but have poor specific impulse.

The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g. product sales and/or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.  Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the \"Ladies' Deposit\".

She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably \"make good\" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment.  Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional \"risk\" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ).  Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.  Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money.

Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).  Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.  The wide gap between \"money in\" and \"fictitious gains\" make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.

{"id":"MARCO_18_1642035430-8","text":"Similar schemes A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a \"hub\" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.  A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.  A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.  By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.  Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes.  For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or \"ICOs\", on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method, known as \" smart Ponzis \" per the Financial Times.

{"id":"MARCO_18_1642035430-9","text":"The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets. Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until inevitable collapse.  A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising.  Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory.  As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value.  A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.  Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant.

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps.  Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.  They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. \nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures.  The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state.  It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.  Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.  Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.  Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines.  These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. \nPressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. \nThe staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.  About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket .  The non-cryogenic N 2 O 4 / UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket . \nAfter the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant.  Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.  The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle.  Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets.  The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2021.  The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.  Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper.  This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. \nThe RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.  Variants Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center.  In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber.  Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist.  Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich.  The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners.  The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion .  Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin-shaft.  In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. \nExamples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners.  Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor.  Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.  In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation.  For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.  Full-flow staged combustion cycle Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners.  The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.  The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. \nBenefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.  Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.  Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber.  This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.  Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. \nAs of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government -funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX 's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019.

If you’re just starting out in your career, why not consider studying a technology or engineering related subject at University, such as Computer Science?  Or, alternatively, study at college whilst working as an apprentice at a local company?  Remember, breaking into the tech and engineering industries isn’t only possible for young people at the beginning of their careers.  Those who are looking to change career could consider studying at evening or weekend classes, or, if it is financially feasible, work part-time whilst studying, 2) Get to know the sector Both the tech and engineering industries are incredibly vast, so in order to narrow down your options it’s worthwhile gaining experience in a few roles.  This will give you direction when job hunting, and give you the opportunity to find local companies that will allow you to shadow them; perhaps you have a family friend that works in tech?  Ask if you can come in for a day or two and see which role or department interests you most.  For a lot of people wanting to break into these industries, salary is the most important factor.

My goal with this post is to help you understand how these two different systems – rack and panniers versus bikepacking bags – work, and how to approach choosing from amongst the wonderful array of options for your next pedal-powered adventure.  Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).

A typical bikepacking bag setup would include some or all of these parts: Handlebar bag (often a roll-style bag) Saddle / seat bag Frame bag Top tube bag for small items Feed bags for snacks and small items Bikepackers sometimes also attach mounts to the front fork for bottles or other small cargo.  This is an example of a bikepacking bag setup: Bikepacking in New Mexico Bikepacking bags are usually (but not always) associated with the “bikepacking” style, loosely defined as: shorter and/or more focused trips within a particular backcountry area, lighter and/or more minimal gear, more dirt trails than roads, more remote than populated, more camping than hotels.

Your legs get more robust with these exercises.  You can cover a longer distance with each stride if you have stronger legs.  Sufficient muscle strength will act as a foundation for power training, which depends on this strength and converts it into speed.  Specialized weight training improves your running performance.  Half Marathon Training with Weight Lifting You need at least two weight training sessions per week.  Here is a list of great strength training exercises for runners.  Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time.  The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights.  To start, your body’s weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix.  Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets.  Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.  You can combine your strength training and easy run or long run sessions on the same day.  Give yourself a 6-hour break between the exercises if possible.

Moisturizer: Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Olive oil is the simplest, purest moisturizer in the world.  It can be used anywhere on your body, including the extra dry spots like your elbows, knees and feet.  It is also an excellent facial moisturizer.  Keep in mind that very little olive oil is needed.  If you use too much, your skin will end up feeling greasy and you may smell a little bit like an Italian restaurant.  Start with a drop the size of a dime and spread evenly across your skin.  Use more as needed.

{"id":"MARCO_26_1067160456","text":" Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable. \nWhile the first stage of this rocket is reusable, the upper stage is not. Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it’s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX’s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4). \nCO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O The Methane (CH4) and water will be collected in separate containers. Starship will use Methane (CH4) and Oxygen (O2) as fuel.  The Martians can drink water (H2O) produced in this step or use it to make Oxygen and Hydrogen.  Astronauts already use these steps to produce Oxygen from water and eliminate Carbon Dioxide at the International Space Station (ISS).  As this process has been tested; therefore, we can also use it on Mars.  The only difference is, ISS releases Methane (CH4) into outer space, while on Mars, we will collect it into containers as rocket fuel.  In the above-described process, we can make both Methane (CH4) and Hydrogen (H2).   Kerosene (RP-1)  Methane Hydrogen Density 813 g/L 422 g/L 70 g/L Oxidizer vs. Fuel Ratio 2.7 : 1 3.7 : 1 6 : 1 Efficiency 370s 459s 532s Combustion Temp 3670 K 3550 K 3070 K Boiling Point 490 K 111 K 20 K Combustion Byproducts CO2, H2O, and black soot.  CO2 and H2O H2O Manufacturable on Mars No Yes Yes In rocketry, the efficiency of an engine is measured in specific impulse (ISP). \nA simplified comparison would be the MPG of our gasoline-powered vehicle. The higher the MPG of a car, the more mileage it can go on 1 gallon of gas, and the more efficient it is.  Now, let’s assume that we have 1lb of rocket fuel.  It could be Kerosene (RP-1), Methane (CH4), or Hydrogen (H2).  ISP is measured in seconds.  It’s the measurement for how many seconds the engine can push with 9.8 newtons of force with a fixed amount of fuel.  The higher it can push with 9.8 newtons with the same amount of fuel, the higher the efficiency or ISP.  If we have one rocket engine with 100s ISP and another one with 150s ISP, then the second engine with 150s ISP is more efficient because it can do more work with the same amount of fuel.  From the above table, we can see that Hydrogen is efficient compared to Methane.  However, Hydrogen has several issues.  SpaceX wants their rocket to be simple, cheap, and reliable.  According to Elon Musk, “ the best part is no part; the best process is no process.”  Though Hydrogen is efficient compared to other rocket propellants, it adds complexity to rocket engines and rocket design.  Hydrogen is a cryogenic fluid. \nIt’s melting point is -259°C or -435°F, and its boiling point is -252°C or -423°F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket. \nTherefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX? \nSpaceX is a privately held company, and Elon Musk is the principal shareholder of SpaceX. During a recent FCC filing, SpaceX revealed that Elon Musk owns 54% of the company with 78% voting control in the SpaceX board. [ 1] Moreover, Elon Musk is the only person who owns more than 10% share of this company.  Can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars?  In 2020, SpaceX’s Starlink started their service.  Like every other product, a new Starlink customer has to sign a legal document.  In that legal document, there is a term which states that: “For Services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonization spacecraft, the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities.  Accordingly, Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.”  Therefore as you can see, if you want to get the Starlink internet, you have to declare, Mars is a free planet.  So, can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars? \nYes, SpaceX can claim Mars because according to a 2015 federal law 114-90, the US government allows a private entity to mine, own, possess, and sell a celestial body, even though the US does not claim it. Therefore, according to that federal law, Elon Musk and SpaceX can claim and mine Mars.  To learn more, please click here.  Bottom Line: SpaceX made the right decision by abandoning Kerosene and Hydrogen and embracing Methane for their Starship.  One day, this Starship would take humans to Mars.

{"id":"MARCO_26_1067160456-1","text":" Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.

Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.

For example, degraded reefs are less productive and may not be able to sustain accretion rates necessary to ensure reefs continue to provide shoreline protection services.  Reefs damaged by coral bleaching can quickly lose many of the features that underpin the aesthetic appeal that is fundamental to reef tourism.  The resultant loss of revenue from reduced tourist activity can threaten the livelihoods of local communities.  Coral bleaching events that lead to significant coral mortality can drive large shifts in fish communities.  This can translate into reduced catches for fishers targeting reef fish species, which in turn leads to impacts on food supply and associated economic activities.  Cultural values of many tropical island communities (e.g., religious sites and traditional uses of marine resources) depend upon healthy coral reef ecosystems and can be adversely affected by coral bleaching.  Coral reefs are a valuable source of pharmaceutical compounds.  Degraded and dead reefs are less likely to serve as a source for important medicinal resources (i.e., drugs to treat heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses).

That said, more collaboration than ever is taking place between banks and fintech firms, leveraging the benefits that each can bring to the table to create customer-centric solutions.  This collaboration has lead to the emergence of Open Banking and APIs, using customer data and innovations to create new revenue streams and more contextual services.  “Fintechs are now earning higher positive customer experience scores than traditional banks, and banks are openly seeking to collaborate with fintechs,” said Anirban Bose, Global Head of Banking and Capital Markets, Capgemini.  “Open Banking offers banks an opportunity to retain and grow their customer base as they add the varied services of third parties to personalize and customize products and services.  For banks that don’t think strategically and establish a role in Open Banking, there is a chance they will be disintermediated from their customers.”  The Evolving Relationship Between Banking and Fintech The emergence and acceptance of digital technology caught the banking industry flat footed.

Many financial services organizations are taking a ‘GAFA’ (Google/Amazon/ Facebook/Apple) approach, leveraging insights and data derived from services and individual organizations to boost their core business.  ( Read More: How Data and New Technologies Are Transforming Digital Lending ) 2. Expansion of Open Banking More and more regulatory bodies globally are requiring banking organizations to enable customers to share their data securely with third parties to power new financial services and increase competition in the banking industry.  By making account and payment data available through secure application programming interfaces (APIs), consumers have greater freedom and control in how they interact with their financial service providers.  Open banking APIs accelerate innovation and collaboration, leading to expanded banking ecosystems that could include more than just financial services to make a consumer’s lifestyle better.  What is exciting about open banking is that making consumer consent a central part of open banking strategy places an increased emphasis on consumer value propositions.  In other words, if improved value isn’t part of the open banking consumer proposition, the customer will not allow the sharing of their data.  Alternatively, those firms that provide the best consumer value proposition will be the relationship winners.

Because of the differences in the structural bodies of men and women, bicycle saddles must reflect these differences.  A man’s seat is usually narrow and long, while that of a woman is wide and short.  A woman’s seat is wide to reflect their generally wide hips.  Women have their pelvic bones set wider apart than men, hence the wide seats.  A major concern for both men and women is too much pressure that can affect the flow of blood to the genitals.  This means that the design of a seat is important.  However, there are unisex seats in the market which can be used by both women and men.  These seats are widely used in most fashions of bicycles, especially those for hire or intended for use for a short period of time.  Also, taller women tend to fit on men’s bike seats and shorter men often prefer women’s seats as their posture on the bicycle tends to be similar.  Women ride differently from men.

This was prior to the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents.  These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire-taps and recording equipment.  Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted.  As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested.  The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders.  Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security.  The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.  By January 1973, the Watergate intruders stood trial for their participation in the break-in.

Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event.  Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse.  John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors.  When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders.  In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in.  The dominoes were now falling one by one.  In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate.  Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up.  Simultaneously, the one piece of evidence that Congress, as well as the federal prosecution, needed was Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office.

Judge Sirica and Congress both refused the compromise and instead sent special prosecutor for the case, Archibald Cox, to present Nixon with a subpoena for the tapes.  In another outlandish move, Nixon used his executive powers to terminate Cox as a prosecutor in what became known as the ' Saturday Night Massacre .'  Nixon Surrenders Nixon's intransigence and outright defiance failed to pay off.  While Nixon attempted to release sanitized versions of his tapes, many had had enough.  On July 24, 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of U.S. v. Nixon that Nixon's use of executive privilege was not applicable in a criminal investigation.  Within weeks of the decision, the House of Representatives approved the impeachment of Nixon on the grounds of obstruction of justice, violation of the constitution and the unlawful withholding of evidence.

Notably, his successor, President Gerald Ford, pardoned Nixon for his involvement in Watergate soon after his resignation.  Lesson Summary President Richard Nixon's well-known paranoia caused him to make irrational decisions which cost him the presidency.  The litmus test for his instability was his handling of the ' Pentagon Papers ' and his involvement in the break-in and subsequent cover-up at the Watergate complex.  Nixon created a secret intelligence team to provide him with constant information on his friends and adversaries.  This intelligence team, which became known as the 'plumbers,' attempted to stop Daniel Ellsberg's leak of confidential information concerning American involvement in the Vietnam War to the media.  While this was a major abuse of executive power, the Watergate Scandal was far worse.  Nixon's powerful victory over George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election was tainted by his actions.  In order to gain an inside edge on his political opponents, Nixon authorized an intelligence team and members of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) to fund the burglary of the Democratic National headquarters at the Watergate complex.  The intruders, however, failed to set the surveillance equipment up properly.

As you probably know, the film The Social Network (2010) loosely followed what happened.  Of course, though, much of it was exaggerated for entertainment purposes.  Founded in 2002, the Winklevoss’s social network was called ConnectU and was very similar to Facebook, many believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea.  ConnectU was originally set up to be a site to connect former Harvard students and eventually other universities.  It had much of the same functionality, such as private messaging and status updates.  The Winklevoss’s received $65 million in Facebook shares and cash from the court case, which suggests that it is very likely that some elements of Facebook were indeed stolen.

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures.  At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe.  Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion.  The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures.  It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.  It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time.  The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers.  Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back.  The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO.  During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives.  It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery. ","title":"Famous Landmarks in Asia - Natural and Manmade","url":"https://www.7continentslist.com/asia/famous-landmarks-in-asia.php"}

Some of the oldest sections of the Great Wall have gone through the process of erosion.  The portion of the wall passing through the province of Gansu is expected to completely disappear in the coming twenty years unless it is reconstructed.  Defensive moats surrounded certain sections of the wall to keep invaders away.  The Great Wall’s highest point is in Beijing where it is constructed at the Heita Mountain rising 1,534 meters high.  It is one of the most visited structures in the world.  According to an estimate made in 2004, more than 41.8 million tourists visited the Great Wall that year.  The most popular section of the Great Wall of China is at Badaling.  It has been visited by more than three-hundred Heads of State as well as other important people from different parts of the world.  Although the wall can be seen from space, astronauts cannot see it with the naked eye.  The raw materials used during the early construction of the structure included compacted earth, stone and wood.  A major rebuilding project was carried out in the fourteenth century during the Ming Dynasty.  The wall was strengthened with stone and bricks.

First of all, don’t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you’re used to.  Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.  Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn’t mean it makes bad phones.  As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don’t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it’s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don’t just go for the latest phones out there.  Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model.

Although jumping rope makes significantly less noise than tap dancing or playing loud music with your sound system speakers on the floor, it can create a slight disturbance.  Even the muffled thud of your feet jumping steadily in your sneakers or other sports training shoes can become a nuisance to other apartment dwellers living below you.  For this reason, you may need to invest in a mat or even some soundproofing installation for your floor.  Can you jump rope on carpet?  Some people jump rope on thin, closely woven carpeting, although you can jump rope on carpet it’s just that jumping on carpets is not usually recommended.  Wood flooring is really the best to jump rope on, but you need to make sure your jumping does not disturb your neighbors before starting your regular jumping routine at home.  Jump rope on concrete If you happen to have concrete floor tiling in your apartment, you should find another space for exercising since jumping rope on a concrete surface can cause pain and injury to your knees.  If you must jump on such hard flooring sometimes, be sure to use a good jump rope mat to absorb most of the impact of your jumping.

One of the biggest factors for me when ranking and recommending a phone is its value in relation to its specs and features.  That typically leads me to recommend phones that may have fewer features or a less sleek design than the ultra-premium models that demand four figures.

Running is one of the highest calorie burn exercises, and because of this is it is a popular choice as part of a weight loss program.  How much you will need to run in order to lose weight depends on a number of factors including how much you eat, how much you can run without getting injured and consistency.  General exercise guidelines for adults recommend moderate exercise about 30 minutes per day.  However, for weight loss exercise will most likely have to be more than this.  Balance calories and quality Anytime you want weight loss, calorie intake should be lower than calorie burn.  Just because you start running doesn’t mean you’ll automatically lose weight.  It can be easy to increase your food intake as you increase your exercising.  Obviously you don’t need to do something as drastic as starving yourself; that will only cause more damage.  However, if you’re not careful it can be easy to match your extra calorie burn from running with extra food intake which could slow weight loss efforts.  If you’re unsure how much food to cut out, start by cutting down food intake about 20%, and speak with a health professional for more individual guidance for weight loss.

Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage.  And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor.  Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality.  For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires.  Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .”  Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death.  Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks.  As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better.  Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better.  Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless.  Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy.  Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate.  On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof.  Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg decide which Jollof tastes better.  Hilarious!  The Ghanians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media.  You won’t blame them.

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).  The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries.  The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.  A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal.  Thank God we know better.

{"id":"MARCO_37_1107517688-3","text":"Other varying ingredients include assorted vegetables, and different types of local spices. Nigerian Jollof Rice The first key difference in Nigerian Jollof is the type of rice grain used.  Nigerian Jollof is made with long grain parboiled rice.  Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria, but imported from Asian countries.  A second difference is the method of cooking.  The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content.  Party Jollof rice, is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations.  This dish is legendary for its smoky taste.  This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour.  A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavour.  Ghanian Jollof Rice Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice.  Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice.  Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell.  Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India.  The basmati rice is not parboiled.  Parboiling makes it soggy.

Ghanian Jollof rice is also more spicy than Nigerian Jollof.  While Nigerians use bay leaf as a key spice, Ghanians use shito, an oily condiment made with hot peppers, ginger, shrimps and onion.  Unlike Nigerian Jollof, Ghanian Jollof rice doesn’t have a party version that is cooked over fire wood.  A Battle of Taste So which Jollof tastes better?  Frankly we can’t seem to decide.

Of course, as Musk adds, some parts of the rocket would need to be replaced or upgraded over time to accomplish this feat.  The first Falcon 9 Block 5 launch in May 2018 (Credit: SpaceX)  So what does Falcon 9 booster refurbishment actually entail?  The exact process is still shrouded in mystery, but we have some clues.  The Merlin engines burn kerosene which results in soot buildup.  It is therefore necessary to desoot the turbines between launches, which Elon Musk described as “ difficult “.  In contrast, the Raptor engine that powers the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster is a much more complex engine than the Merlin, but because it uses methane which burns much more cleanly than kerosene, it is easier to reuse because there is no desooting needed.  According to Musk, when it comes to Raptor’s easy reusability, “not having long chain hydrocarbons & lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference”.

After completing the optimistic anthem, songwriters Bob Thiele and George David Weiss thought that Tony Bennett would eat it right up.  He subsequently passed, so the duo contacted Armstrong in August 1967.  10.  \"What a Wonderful World\" didn't make a splash in the U.S. until well after Louis Armstrong's death.

Although the ballad topped the 1968 charts in Great Britain, American sales were abysmal.  When Pops (who adored Thiele and Weiss’ masterwork) passed away on July 6, 1971, “What a Wonderful World” seemed destined for stateside obscurity.  Then along came a bare-knuckled comedy called Good Morning, Vietnam (1987).  The joyous tune perfectly and ironically clashed with the wartime horrors depicted in one montage, so director Barry Levinson added it to his film’s soundtrack.  “What a Wonderful World” struck a chord with moviegoers and was re-released that year, becoming an oft-requested radio hit.

You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.  Essential oils are extracted from plants and can be less potentially irritating or allergenic.

Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.

Here are some of the easiest and useful tips on increasing your teenager’s self confidence.  1.  Show Respect: Do not forget – your teenager is not a child anymore and is a near-adult, and as such, deserves respect just like any other adult.  When you address your teenager, always show respect.  Do not let disdain or contempt show in your tone!  Always treat their problems and fears with importance.  Never shun off your teenager’s fears as a childhood worry.  [ Read: Common Problems Of Adolescence ] 2. Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often.  Be generous with your compliments.  When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds.  It encourages them to do even better next time.  Always express yourself and let them know how good and proud you feel to have them as your kid.  3  .  Avoid Criticism: Try and avoid criticising as much as you can.  Criticism can be detrimental for your teenager’s self confidence.  If you disapprove or dislike something that involves your teen, take time to sit with them and talk it out.

Encourage Extra Curricular Activities: Let your teenager follow his hobbies.  Encourage him to participate in more and more activities.  It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys.  Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence.  These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal.  [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5.  Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make.  Teach him about respect and acceptance.  Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important.  Teach him that value is what matters between friends.  The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence.  Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends.  6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure.  To them looks matter a lot.  They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely.  It is important to sit and explain to your teenager that looks do not matter.

Never compare your teenager to his peers, friends, siblings and cousins.  Your teen should realize how different people have different strengths.  Comparison creates rivalry.  Make your teenager understand that his only competition is with himself.  And the best way to do even better is to focus on strengths. 8.  Teach Them To Be Stronger : Teach your teenager to build some tolerance level towards teasing or heckling.  Teasing affects every teenager’s self confidence.  A good rule in life is grin and bears it.  Your teenager must learn to tolerate negative emotions to some extent, without losing his cool Your teenager must know that teasing cannot hurt and it should in no way affect his self confidence.  9.  Look For Professional Help: If your teenager suffers from severe lack of confidence and it is starting to affect his academic and/or social life, you may need help from external sources.  Initially, you can try for family counseling with your teen’s favorite relatives.  If the above does not work, it is best to seek professional help, which might uncover the real issue behind this lacking and help your teenager come out of it. 10.

Regular updates send a signal for where low-carbon investments can be made, and the resources available to help the most vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Broadening the donor base The broadening of the donor pool is important, because it recognizes the fact that many developing countries are already contributing climate finance.

Countries including Vietnam and Chile have already pledged funds to the Green Climate Fund, and China has pledged $3.1 billion for South-South cooperation between developing countries.  The new Agreement makes clear that developed countries are not shirking their responsibilities for climate finance --- which is a responsibility already recognized as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions.  To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.  While the Paris Agreement doesn’t have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal.

There is some evidence that larger amounts of iron may be deposited in the ocean in the future as global warming results in more windblown continental dust.  Theoretically, sea spray and water vapor form low clouds that ultimately cool temperatures at the surface.

Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task. \nSome search engine platforms use Snopes to “validate”…but Snopes has an aggressive political agenda of their own, courtesy of their primary financier. The bias is probably not apparent to those already eager to hear what these platforms want us to hear.  I’m still looking; I already avoid the absolute worst but I know I don’t yet have the kind of impartiality I want.  [ Much later note: So far I’ve gone to trying Bing, having walked away permanently from G and then eventually Y as well.  In 4 months I have at least not been overtly insulted yet by Bing.

There is no algorithm at Google or Bing that takes politics into account.

Authoritative websites are places like Universities (which tend to favour evidence-based research) and media organisations. \nMost of the rest of what puts a site at the top of a search engine is how users interact with it - do they find the result useful? This could show a bias because people have opinions - more people might click on one result that they agree with more than the other.  Your mention of autocomplete is not bias either.  It is based on what people actually search - search engines do not just decide what goes in the autocomplete list arbitrarily.  So, in a sense search engines are unintentionally biased towards what the majority think, because this is what powers their results.  There is no conspiracy, however :) As a side note to this, Google have been attempting to rank based on verifiability, using sites like Snopes to try and push sites that are genuinely reporting the truth higher up the search results.

Judging from your question, which asks about the company vs. the owners, I can probably assume you understand that distinction.  For example, Chic Fil’A’s COO made a statement that he supports traditional marriage (yes, that’s all he said).  This may still offend a lot of people on the Left, which is understandable, but it honestly should not affect their decision to buy their product.  It’s not a company-wide stance, and I have many Left-leaning friends who still eat there without a thought.  Ben & Jerry’s is an example on the opposite end of the spectrum - the owners are very Left-wing, but they NEVER made it a public opinion that the company itself prides itself on these politics.  So I have no problem on either side continuing to enjoy these great products. \nNike, on the other hand (which I assume you’re probably hinting towards), did indeed make it public statement from the company itself, where it stands politically with its portrayal of Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling during the national anthem, making the situation completely different. I fully support anyone not buying Nike products if they disagree with this statement.  And to be fair, I would fully support any person on the Left who boycots companies any product proudly spouting Right-wing agendas.  A company needs to be held responsible if they start to get political when, in most cases, there’s really no need to if they have a great product.  So all in all, I don’t see anything behind DuckDuckGo representing either side, nor can I even find anything about its ownership.

Researching this way is the only way to see both sides of the spectrum and make a rational decision.  It allows you to better argue a stance as well, when you know where the other side stands.  Try it out, it’s better than Google in my opinion.  Like Trump said, what have you got to lose.  Robert Rossney, Engineer at Google, Chris O'Leary Internet Marketing Strategist. \nRobert, the first line in your post is biased based on the simple fact that you are implying that good and conservative are separate; and you work for google! So who decides what is factual?  This is where the problem lies and why people want the opportunity to view both sides of the spectrum.  We don’t get that from the google search engine.  Regarding the, “use of certain terms in their discourse that aren’t being used by their political opposition” statement you made, you are confused.  The left and all their media groupies are notorious for using identical robotic terminology, so much that people often search terms that have been beaten into their brains by the left media entities.  Examples include: “existential crisis,” “bombshell report,” “weapons of war,” common sense gun control,” etc.  All the left wing media is scripted to beat these terms into their viewers and in turn when someone wants to look up one of these issues, they are presented by sources that spewed the same terms.  Google any one of these and you will see that there isn’t one single conservative result that is right leaning on the first page and when you do find one, searching page after page, it is usually just one followed by more left leaning results. \nDon’t pretend to assume what conservatives think, we know your search engine is biased, just as well as all those who run google. I’d be a little leery if you decide to buy into Chris O’Learys post.  Sorry Chris, but I can prove your little algorithm theory is bunk.  I encourage you to google, “Trump Ukraine Transcript” and come back to me with your results.  One would assume that since the President publicized the ACTUAL TRANSCRIPT, that when you googled it you would find it in the first result on a .gov site or at least find the .gov site on the first page, right?  Wrong!  For at least the first week, the first five results were CNN, NBC, NBC, CNN, and NBC.  The first .gov result, with something other than a biased assessment of the transcript, was on page 5.  How is that unbiased?!  Fox is now #2, under CNN, long after people lost interest or had already gained knowledge of what they assume is the transcript.  This is misleading, as a .gov website with the actual transcript should have been # 1 from day 1, in addition to still being #1.  People need facts and regardless of what source it is coming from, it will always be biased to some extent. \nThe problem us conservatives and libertarians have is that we have a very hard time accepting things without facts. Something as direct as an actual report from the white house being buried beneath opinion, biased based entities only furthers our belief that google is left leaning in its results.  So if you still disagree, I would love to hear how you can argue that they are not biased and explain this for us simple folk.  Related Answer Ian Lurie , Long-time search engine geek.

I believe that DuckDuckGo is the best available competitor to Google search engine and I also believe that if there is a search engine that could replace Google someday, it should be DuckDuckGo. \nBut at this moment, I feel that there is a huge gap between Google and DuckDuckGo. I believe that DuckDuckGo is working on bridging the gap.  In what areas, DuckDuckGo scores over Google?  Privacy: The foremost philosophy of DuckDuckGo is to respect the privacy of it’s users and not tracking them.  Web Search Results: In general I would say that the web search results are more or less satisfactory in both the search engines.  But I would say that DuckDuckGo is the winner considering that they don’t personalize the results.  In my opinion, personalized results are good in some cases, but I’m mostly happy to see all kind of results than the personalized results.  Q/A section: DuckDuckGo has a dedicated Q/A section which helps me a lot when I do tech-related searches.  The results from StackOverflow and other forums are primarily shown in the Q/A section which is very useful to me to solve the issues I get while I practice code.  Zero-click information: For tech related searches, I mostly get the solution on top as mentioned in Akshay Mendki in his answer.  Just look the results I got for “ how do I check the version of python in windows ” in DuckDuckGo and Google below.  DuckDuckGo wins easily. \nBut wait, I’m sure that Google will easily implement the features like Q/A section and Quick Solution to bridge the gap between Google and DuckDuckGo. Quick Links: When I generally do movie related searches, I get the links for Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, IMDb etc on the top of the results.  In most cases, Wikipedia and IMDb are things I look for.  I need not scroll down for that.  I can click on the very first screen I get.  Night-Mode: For a 24x7 online user like me, night mode is essential.  It’s also aesthetically pleasing and I mostly use this mode in DDG.  Less ads: Who else is not happy with lesser ads?  Where does DDG lag behind Google?  Image Search: The web search results in DuckDuckGo are on par with Google results but I don’t know why, the image results are pathetic in DuckDuckGo.  Sometimes, I don’t get any search results at all unless I switch off the safe search.  Some cases, the results are very limited and I don’t get what I look for, end up looking for the image in Bing or Google.  Navigation: This is a big drawback and difficult to bridge the gap.  Google easily wins. \nWhenever I look for Navigation, I need to switch back to Google. Not every user would like to switch between two search engines often.  Translitration: Just type a non-English word in English in DuckDuckGo.  For example, I searched for “pavazhamalli” It’s a name of a flower in Tamil.  Since I typed in English, none of the results contain the words “பவழமல்லி” which is how pavazhamalli is spelled in Tamil.  So, I’m missing the results of he webpages that are totally in written in regional languages.  On the other hand, Google gives some results for the tamil word also.  DuckDuckGo lags behind Google in this area.  But even google needs to improve in this area.  Overall, I’m amazed by DuckDuckGo, a small company with 50 employees challenging a tech-giant like Google.  As a regular user of DuckDuckGo, I find a improvement in the relevance of their search results.  Compared to few months ago, I feel that their results are now more relevant to what I exactly expect.  Especially for tech related searches I find DuckDuckGo to be much superior to Google, but overall, there is a long way to go.

The ideal for many: a rigid (no suspension or a suspension fork with lockout) 29er or 27.5 mountain bike with mechanical disc brakes and a multi-position handlebar.

To simplify a complicated process, it’s enough for you to know that the job of these software crawlers (also known as search engine spiders), is to scan the Internet and find the servers (also known as webservers) hosting websites.  They create a list of all the webservers to crawl, the number of websites hosted by each server and then start work.  They visit each website and by using different techniques, they try to find out how many pages they have, whether it is text content, images, videos or any other format (CSS, HTML, javascript, etc).  When visiting a website, besides taking note of the number of pages they also follow any links (either pointing to pages within the site or to external websites), and thus they discover more and more pages.  They do this continuously and they also keep track of changes made to a website so that they know when new pages are added or deleted, when links are updated, etc. ","title":"How Do Search Engines Work & Why You Should Care","url":"https://www.reliablesoft.net/how-search-engines-work/"}

While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.

A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance.  Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores.  This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism.  The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles.  However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance.  At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health.  Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training.  This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast.  So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes.

(450,000 kilograms) of a propellant, a solid mixture of ammonium perchlorate and aluminum, as well as an iron oxide catalyst to aid the burning reaction and a \"binder\" material to hold all the components together, according to the American Chemistry Council.  The entire mixture has the consistency of a pencil eraser.  Ammonium perchlorate is also used by the U.S. military in rockets, explosives, flares and ammunition.  The 15-story, rust-colored external tank was the only shuttle component that was not reused.  It fed more than 500,000 gallons of fuel — liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen — to the shuttle's main engines during launch.  The tank was also the \"backbone\" of the space shuttle structure.  It provided support for the rocket boosters and orbiter.  The external tank was the only part of the space shuttle not reused from launch to launch.  It served as the \"gas tank\" for the space shuttle on launch.  Once empty, this huge orange tank separated from the rest of the apparatus and fell back to Earth.

{"id":"MARCO_52_1730323313-2","text":"So here follows, for possibly the first time in history, an entire article in the national press on the net benefits of climate change. There are many likely effects of climate change: positive and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial.  And if you aggregate them all, the overall effect is positive today — and likely to stay positive until around 2080.  That was the conclusion of Professor Richard Tol of Sussex University after he reviewed 14 different studies of the effects of future climate trends.  To be precise, Prof Tol calculated that climate change would be beneficial up to 2.2˚C of warming from 2009 (when he wrote his paper).  This means approximately 3˚C from pre-industrial levels, since about 0.8˚C of warming has happened in the last 150 years.  The latest estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that such temperatures may not be reached till the end of the century — if at all.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose reports define the consensis, is sticking to older assumptions, however, which would mean net benefits till about 2080.  Either way, it’s a long way off. ","title":"","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/10/carry-on-warming/"}

By making a few simple adjustments, your bike will be a perfect fit.  Making sure your saddle and handlebars are set up correctly will give you a much more comfortable and efficient ride.  Riding position Your riding position can be altered by adjusting the saddle and handlebars.  There are three things you want to achieve: The right saddle height – to make the most of your leg power and to make sure you can put a reassuring foot on the ground.  Good contact with your pedals to maximise the power in your legs.  Ability to reach the handlebars and your brakes – for good control and comfort.  Everyone is different so you will need to find a comfortable balance that suits you.  Handlebar position Well-positioned handlebars are crucial for your comfort and important for control of your steering and brakes.  Handlebars vary in how they can be adjusted.  A good position to start is with your handlebars at the same height as your saddle.  If you prefer a more aerodynamic ‘head down’ position, lower the bars.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: \"  [  T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.  Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries.  \"While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.” ","title":"Search engine bias: What search results are telling you (and what they're not) - TechRepublic","url":"https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/search-engine-bias-what-search-results-are-telling-you-and-what-theyre-not/"}

And just as the naysayers say size doesn’t matter, you realise that in West Africa, where just a couple of miles adds another fascinating tribal group, or that journey over the Obudu Plateau makes the difference between Guinean savannah grasses and verdant tropical rainforest, it really, really does!  The point is that Nigeria is a country of many colors and creeds.  Its character morphs and shapeshifts almost as elegantly as a white-throated monkey swings between the boughs of the jungle.  City wise, it’s got the colossal sprawl of Abuja – one of the fastest growing urban areas in the world.  And then there’s Lagos – 17.5 million strong, but still finding time to chill on the Atlantic beaches.  Moving away from the towns and to the country, and Nigeria’s many faces continue.  This time they peer like humans in the form of chimpanzees from the forest-clad gorges of the Gashaka Gumti.  Or, they are plumed in pink like the black cranes of the Bade-Nguru Wetlands.  It’s all very wonderful stuff. ","title":"15 Best Places to Visit in Nigeria - The Crazy Tourist","url":"https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-places-visit-nigeria/"}
{"id":"MARCO_54_575373635-2","text":"Lets explore the best places to visit in Nigeria: 1. Calabar Source: flickr Calabar The gateway to the reserves of the Cross River (the state of which Calabar is the capital), and the further-flung rainforests of the Afi Mountains (home to gorillas, chimps, rare rockfowl and craggy peaks of stone), the town of Calabar is a well-honed tourist stop-off on the way through to Cameroon or the southern Nigerian coast.  Before making a beeline for the amazing primate sanctuaries outside of the town though, be sure to linger a little and case out the darker past of the city at the Calabar Museum – Calabar was once one of the principle slave trading ports in West Africa.  Also worth a look is the Duke Town chapel, which is considered one of the oldest Christian worshipping houses in Nigeria. 2. Lagos Source: flickr Lagos Frenetic and packed, Lagos is not only the largest city in Nigeria, but also the single largest on the entire African continent.  Yep, nearly 18 million people call this one home, and boy does it show!  Throbbing streets of beer bars and clubs pepper the districts of Ikeja and Victoria Island, where ex-pats and sailors and locals alike chat over frothy brews.

{"id":"MARCO_54_575373635-3","text":"There are also salt-washed promenades on the coast, and the beautiful reaches of Lagos Bar Beach – a sloping stretch of golden sand that meets the waves of the Atlantic Ocean in style. Meanwhile, jet skis purr across Tarkwa Bay, and the sobering histories of the slave trade continue to move at the Point of No Return.  3  . Abeokuta Source: flickr Abeokuta Nestled inland, directly north of sprawling Lagos, the regional capital of the Ogun State can be found surrounded by great swathes of yam fields and maize farms, swaying wooded savanna and palm oil plantations.  An historic location on the important trade routes between the coast and the heart of West Africa led to previous inhabitants raising adobe fortifications around the old town, many of which can still be seen today.  However, it’s the bulbous rises of the Olumo Rock that soars atop the town that really draws the eye.  This ancient natural fort plays host to a great cultural museum, a craft shop selling local artworks, and caves that showcase the human history of the Ogun region as a whole.  4.

{"id":"MARCO_54_575373635-4","text":"Yankari National Park Source: flickr Yankari National Park Whether you make the arduous journey east from Abuja and south from Gombe to the Yankari in search of the roaming herds of African elephants (rumored to be the most numerous on the continent) or to seek out the fascinating relics of earlier peoples in the caves, you can rest assured that this well-serviced national park won’t disappoint. More than 20,000 people come here to partake in ecotourism every year, which means there are plenty of lodges and tour operators on the ground.  Don’t leave without scaling the lookouts on Kalban Hill, or wondering at the chiseled rocks of the awesome Tonlong Gorge.  5.  Abuja Source: flickr Abuja Okay, so Abuja ain’t no Lagos.  Purpose-built, enfolded by the soft topography of the inland hills, and formed from clearly delineated districts that house business-suited men and politicians, there’s no grit or grime here (or at least not relatively).  That means the capital is a nice place to relax and unwind following the energy and action of the megalopolis on the coast.  And there are other interesting sights too, like the Abuja Millennium Park and the quad of spear-like minarets that heralds the beautiful Abuja National Mosque.

Ibadan Source: flickr Ibadan State capital and erstwhile stronghold of the old Oyo Empire, Ibadan hides quite a lot of history and heritage between its streets.  The only problem is, those streets seem to go on forever and ever (some estimations say that Ibadan is the single largest metropolis by geographical coverage in Africa), making the interesting parts pretty hard to find!  A good place to start is in the exhibition rooms of the National Museum of Ibadan, where traditional Egungun garments meet tribal war drums and more.  Then, try to discover the Bower Memorial Tower, before hitting the colonial facades of Mapo Hall. 7.  Kainji Lake National Park Source: flickr Kainji Lake National Park One of the natural jewels of north-western Nigeria is actually not all that natural at all.  Yep, the eponymous Kainji Lake of the Kainji Lake National Park is actually a reservoir, created in 1968 and now surrounded by protected game reserves.  On the western banks of the water is the Borgu area, which hosts sporadic pockets of Guinean woods and plains, the stomping ground of some truly fascinating beasts: hippopotami; roan antelopes and swinging baboons.
