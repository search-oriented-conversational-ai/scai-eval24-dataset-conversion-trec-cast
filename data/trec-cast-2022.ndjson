For example, while by all indications, Windows Phone 7 is excellent, there are just not that many out there.  That's a shame, but it's true.  I didn't discuss them as a choice here because I've never, ever, not once have someone ask whether they should get a Windows Phone instead of an iPhone or Android phone.  If you like to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight, go for one of these fringe phones.  Otherwise, you're probably choosing Android or iPhone.  Wrap-up So, as you can see, there's no clear winner.  In my mind, though, depending on what you need, you'll lean one way or the other.

Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.

As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don\u2019t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it\u2019s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don\u2019t just go for the latest phones out there.  Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model.

For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.

Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.

Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.

As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don\u2019t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it\u2019s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don\u2019t just go for the latest phones out there.

Notably, his successor, President Gerald Ford, pardoned Nixon for his involvement in Watergate soon after his resignation.  Lesson Summary President Richard Nixon's well-known paranoia caused him to make irrational decisions which cost him the presidency.  The litmus test for his instability was his handling of the ' Pentagon Papers ' and his involvement in the break-in and subsequent cover-up at the Watergate complex.  Nixon created a secret intelligence team to provide him with constant information on his friends and adversaries.  This intelligence team, which became known as the 'plumbers,' attempted to stop Daniel Ellsberg's leak of confidential information concerning American involvement in the Vietnam War to the media.  While this was a major abuse of executive power, the Watergate Scandal was far worse.  Nixon's powerful victory over George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election was tainted by his actions.  In order to gain an inside edge on his political opponents, Nixon authorized an intelligence team and members of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) to fund the burglary of the Democratic National headquarters at the Watergate complex.  The intruders, however, failed to set the surveillance equipment up properly.

The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger\u2013Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.  One tradition says that Abasi's wife Atai persuaded him to let two of their children, a daughter and son, settle on the earth.  They were not allowed to breed, but disobeyed this injunction and became the ancestors of the Efik people.

The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.

The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g. product sales and/or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.

The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed \u2013 this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

Broadly, merienda is any sort of dish or snack in a portion smaller than the traditional \"full meal\" consisting of rice and a complementary viand (unless the merienda is taken as brunch or merienda cena ), coupled with either a cool or hot drink (usually coffee).  Common fare may be sweet or savoury, ranging from breads and pastries (notably pandesal ), desserts and sweets, street food, to noodle dishes.  In coastal parts of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, and on the Greek island of Corfu, it is referred to marenda, a meal eaten between breakfast and lunch.

SpaceX\u2019s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It\u2019s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let\u2019s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It\u2019s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX\u2019s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable. \nWhile the first stage of this rocket is reusable, the upper stage is not. Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it\u2019s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX\u2019s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4). \nCO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O The Methane (CH4) and water will be collected in separate containers. Starship will use Methane (CH4) and Oxygen (O2) as fuel.  The Martians can drink water (H2O) produced in this step or use it to make Oxygen and Hydrogen.  Astronauts already use these steps to produce Oxygen from water and eliminate Carbon Dioxide at the International Space Station (ISS).  As this process has been tested; therefore, we can also use it on Mars.  The only difference is, ISS releases Methane (CH4) into outer space, while on Mars, we will collect it into containers as rocket fuel.  In the above-described process, we can make both Methane (CH4) and Hydrogen (H2).   Kerosene (RP-1)  Methane Hydrogen Density 813 g/L 422 g/L 70 g/L Oxidizer vs. Fuel Ratio 2.7 : 1 3.7 : 1 6 : 1 Efficiency 370s 459s 532s Combustion Temp 3670 K 3550 K 3070 K Boiling Point 490 K 111 K 20 K Combustion Byproducts CO2, H2O, and black soot.  CO2 and H2O H2O Manufacturable on Mars No Yes Yes In rocketry, the efficiency of an engine is measured in specific impulse (ISP). \nA simplified comparison would be the MPG of our gasoline-powered vehicle. The higher the MPG of a car, the more mileage it can go on 1 gallon of gas, and the more efficient it is.  Now, let\u2019s assume that we have 1lb of rocket fuel.  It could be Kerosene (RP-1), Methane (CH4), or Hydrogen (H2).  ISP is measured in seconds.  It\u2019s the measurement for how many seconds the engine can push with 9.8 newtons of force with a fixed amount of fuel.  The higher it can push with 9.8 newtons with the same amount of fuel, the higher the efficiency or ISP.  If we have one rocket engine with 100s ISP and another one with 150s ISP, then the second engine with 150s ISP is more efficient because it can do more work with the same amount of fuel.  From the above table, we can see that Hydrogen is efficient compared to Methane.  However, Hydrogen has several issues.  SpaceX wants their rocket to be simple, cheap, and reliable.  According to Elon Musk, \u201c the best part is no part; the best process is no process.\u201d  Though Hydrogen is efficient compared to other rocket propellants, it adds complexity to rocket engines and rocket design.  Hydrogen is a cryogenic fluid. \nIt\u2019s melting point is -259\u00b0C or -435\u00b0F, and its boiling point is -252\u00b0C or -423\u00b0F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen\u2019s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth\u2019s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket\u2019s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket. \nTherefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX? \nSpaceX is a privately held company, and Elon Musk is the principal shareholder of SpaceX. During a recent FCC filing, SpaceX revealed that Elon Musk owns 54% of the company with 78% voting control in the SpaceX board. [ 1] Moreover, Elon Musk is the only person who owns more than 10% share of this company.  Can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars?  In 2020, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink started their service.  Like every other product, a new Starlink customer has to sign a legal document.  In that legal document, there is a term which states that: \u201cFor Services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonization spacecraft, the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities.  Accordingly, Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.\u201d  Therefore as you can see, if you want to get the Starlink internet, you have to declare, Mars is a free planet.  So, can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars? \nYes, SpaceX can claim Mars because according to a 2015 federal law 114-90, the US government allows a private entity to mine, own, possess, and sell a celestial body, even though the US does not claim it. Therefore, according to that federal law, Elon Musk and SpaceX can claim and mine Mars.  To learn more, please click here.  Bottom Line: SpaceX made the right decision by abandoning Kerosene and Hydrogen and embracing Methane for their Starship.  One day, this Starship would take humans to Mars.

The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber.  The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries.  An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor.  The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent it from overheating.  The electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps.

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps.  Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.  They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. \nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures.  The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state.  It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.  Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.  Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.  Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines.  These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. \nPressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. \nThe staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.  About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket .  The non-cryogenic N 2 O 4 / UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket . \nAfter the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant.  Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.  The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle.  Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets.  The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2021.  The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.  Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper.  This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. \nThe RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.  Variants Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center.  In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber.  Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist.  Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich.  The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners.  The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion .  Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin-shaft.  In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. \nExamples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners.  Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor.  Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.  In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation.  For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.  Full-flow staged combustion cycle Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners.  The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.  The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. \nBenefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.  Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.  Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber.  This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.  Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. \nAs of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government -funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX 's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019. The first flight test of a full-flow staged-combustion engine occurred on 25 July 2019 when SpaceX flew their Raptor methalox FFSC engine at their South Texas Launch Site.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.  Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.   The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.   By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

The electric is the simplest of these being powered by a battery, but these can be heavy and are only recently becoming possible. Open cycle uses some of the fuel and oxidizer to run the pump and exhausts the rest at the expense of efficiency.

Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded.  Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling.  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle .  There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.  The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine. \nThis is seen in the F-1 and Merlin 1D Vacuum rocket engines used on the Saturn V booster stage and the Falcon 9 second stage, respectively. As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).  The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.  Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.  Engines using this system are mechanically simple, but have poor specific impulse.

The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber.  The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries.  An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor.  The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent it from overheating.  The electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps.  This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.  An electric cycle engine uses electric pumps to pressurize the propellants from a low-pressure fuel tank to high-pressure combustion chamber levels, generally from 0.2 to 0.3 MPa (29 to 44 psi) to 10 to 20 MPa (1,500 to 2,900 psi).  The pumps are powered by an electric motor, with electricity from a battery bank. \nElectrical pumps had been used in the secondary propulsion system of the Agena upper stage vehicle. As of December 2020, the only rocket engines to use electric propellant pump systems are the Rutherford engine, nine of which power the Electron rocket, and the Delphin engine, five of which power the first stage of Astra Space 's Rocket 3.  On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.  In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps.  Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.  They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. \nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures.  The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state.  It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.  Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.  Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.  Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines.  These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. \nPressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. \nThe staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.  About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket .  The non-cryogenic N 2 O 4 / UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket . \nAfter the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant.  Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.  The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle.  Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets.  The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2021.  The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.  Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper.  This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. \nThe RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.  Variants Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center.  In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber.  Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist.  Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich.  The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners.  The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion .  Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin-shaft.  In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. \nExamples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners.  Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor.  Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.  In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation.  For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.  Full-flow staged combustion cycle Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners.  The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.  The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. \nBenefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.  Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.  Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber.  This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.  Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. \nAs of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government -funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX 's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019. The first flight test of a full-flow staged-combustion engine occurred on 25 July 2019 when SpaceX flew their Raptor methalox FFSC engine at their South Texas Launch Site.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.  Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.   The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.   By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

The engines are powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in both the Merlin and Kestrel rocket engine families.  The earliest concepts for Raptor considered liquid hydrogen () as fuel rather than methane.  The Raptor engine is currently planned to have about two times the thrust of the Merlin 1D engine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle.   The current Raptor concept as announced in 2013 is \"a highly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars\".   A variety of Raptor engines are planned to be used on both stages of the super heavy-lift launch vehicle BFR, which will have a smaller number of engines than originally planned.   Section::::Description.   The Raptor engine is powered by subcooled liquid methane and subcooled liquid oxygen using a more efficient staged combustion cycle, a departure from the simpler 'open cycle' gas generator system and lox/kerosene propellants that current Merlin engines use. \nThe Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME, with hydrolox propellant) also used a staged combustion process, as do several Russian rocket engines including the RD-180 and the chamber pressure RD-191. The stated design size for the Raptor engine varied widely during 2012\u20132017 as detailed design continued, from a high target of of vacuum thrust to a more recent, much lower target of .  In its 2017 iteration, the operational engine is expected to have a vacuum I of 375 seconds and a sea-level I of 300 seconds.   The Raptor engine is designed for the use of deep cryogenic propellants\u2014fluids cooled to near their freezing points, rather than nearer their boiling points which is more typical for cryogenic rocket engines.  The use of subcooled propellants increases propellant density to allow more propellant mass in tanks; the engine performance is also improved with sub cooled propellants.  Specific impulse is increased, and the risk of cavitation at inputs to the turbopumps is reduced due to the higher mass flow rate per unit power generated.  Engine ignition for all Raptor engines, both on the pad and in the air, will be by spark ignition, which will eliminate the pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) used for engine ignition on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. \n Raptor has been claimed to be able to deliver \"long life ... and more benign turbine environments\". Specifically, Raptor utilizes a full-flow staged combustion cycle, where 100 percent of the oxidizer\u2014with a low-fuel ratio\u2014will power the oxygen turbine pump, and 100 percent of the fuel\u2014with a low-oxygen ratio\u2014will power the methane turbine pump.  Both streams\u2014oxidizer and fuel\u2014will be mixed completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber.  Prior to 2014, only two full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands: the Soviet RD-270 project in the 1960s and the Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator in the mid-2000s.   Additional characteristics of the full-flow design, projected to further increase performance or reliability include:  BULLET::::- eliminating the fuel-oxidizer turbine interseal, which is a potential point of failure in more traditional engine designs  BULLET::::- lower pressures are required through the pumping system, increasing life span and further reducing risk of catastrophic failure  BULLET::::- ability to increase the combustion chamber pressure, thereby either increasing overall performance, or \"by using cooler gases, providing the same performance as a standard staged combustion engine but with much less stress on materials, thus significantly reducing material fatigue or [ \nengine] weight\".  The turbopump and many of the critical parts of the injectors for the initial engine development testing were, as of 2015, manufactured by using 3D printing, which increases the speed of development and iterative testing.  Forty percent (by mass) of the 2016 test stand engine was manufactured by 3D printing.   The Raptor engine uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors to admit propellants to the combustion chamber, rather than pintle injectors used on the previous Merlin rocket engines that SpaceX mass-produced for its Falcon family of launch vehicles.   Section::::History.   The engine development from 2009 to 2015 was funded exclusively through private investment by SpaceX, and not as a result of any funding from the US government.  In January 2016, SpaceX did agree with the US Air Force to take in defense department funding in order to develop a particular Raptor model: a prototype of a new upper-stage variant of the Raptor engine designed for potential use as an upper stage on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, with SpaceX agreeing to fund at least on the same upper-stage development project, on a minimum 2:1 private-to-government funding basis.   Section::::History.:Initial concept. \n An advanced rocket engine design project named \"Raptor\"\u2014then a hydrolox engine\u2014was first publicly discussed by SpaceX's Max Vozoff at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Commercial Crew/Cargo symposium in 2009. , SpaceX had a small number of staff working on the Raptor upper-stage engine, then still a /LOX concept, at a low level of priority.  Further mention of the development program occurred in 2011.  In March 2012, news accounts asserted that the Raptor upper-stage engine development program was underway, but that details were not being publicly released.   In October 2012, SpaceX publicly announced concept work on a rocket engine that would be \"several times as powerful as the Merlin 1 series of engines, and won't use Merlin's RP-1 fuel\", but declined to specify which fuel would be used.  They indicated that details on a new SpaceX rocket would be forthcoming in \"one to three years\" and that the large engine was intended for the next-generation launch vehicle using multiple of these large engines, that would be expected to launch payload masses of the order of to low Earth orbit, exceeding the payload mass capability of the NASA Space Launch System.   Section::::History.:Methane engine announcement and component development. \n In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for the propulsion division of SpaceX: developing methane-fueled rocket engines. He further indicated that the engine concept, codenamed Raptor, would now become a methane-based design, and that methane would be the fuel of choice for SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization.   Because of the presence of water underground and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars, methane, a simple hydrocarbon, can easily be synthesized on Mars using the Sabatier reaction.  In-situ resource production on Mars has been examined by NASA and found to be viable for oxygen, water, and methane production.  According to a study published by researchers from the Colorado School of Mines, in-situ resource utilization such as methane from Mars makes space missions more feasible technically and economically and enables reusability. \n When first mentioned by SpaceX in 2009, the term \"Raptor\" was applied exclusively to an upper-stage engine concept\u2014and 2012 pronouncements indicated that it was then still a concept for an upper stage engine\u2014but in early 2014 SpaceX confirmed that Raptor would be used both on a new second stage, as well as for the large (then, nominally a 10-meter-diameter) core of the then-named Mars Colonial Transporter (subsequently, in 2016, on both stages of the even larger ITS launch vehicle concept and then, in 2017 and 2018, on the currently-in-development 9-meter diameter BFR).  The earliest public hints that a staged-combustion methane engine was under consideration at SpaceX were given in May 2011 when SpaceX asked if the Air Force was interested in a methane-fueled engine as an option to compete with the mainline kerosene-fueled engine that had been requested in the USAF \"Reusable Booster System High Thrust Main Engine\" solicitation.   Public information released in November 2012 indicated that SpaceX might have a family of Raptor-designated rocket engines in mind; this was confirmed by SpaceX in October 2013. \nHowever, in March 2014 SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that the focus of the new engine development program is exclusively on the full-size Raptor engine; smaller subscale methalox engines were not planned on the development path to the very large Raptor engine.  In October 2013, SpaceX announced that they would be performing methane engine tests of Raptor engine components at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, and that SpaceX would add equipment to the existing test stand infrastructure in order to support liquid methane and hot gaseous methane engine component testing.  In April 2014, SpaceX completed the requisite upgrades and maintenance to the Stennis test stand to prepare for testing of Raptor components, and the engine component testing program began in earnest, focusing on the development of robust startup and shutdown procedures, something that is typically quite difficult to do for full-flow staged combustion cycle engines.  Component testing at Stennis also allowed hardware characterization and verification of proprietary analytical software models that SpaceX developed to push the technology on this engine cycle that had little prior development work in the West. \n October 2013 was the first time SpaceX disclosed a nominal design thrust of the Raptor engine\u2014\u2014although early in 2014 they announced a Raptor engine with greater thrust, and in 2015, one with lower thrust that might better optimize thrust-to-weight.  In February 2014, Tom Mueller, the head of rocket engine development at SpaceX, revealed in a speech that Raptor was being designed for use on a vehicle where nine engines would \"put over 100 tons of cargo up to Mars\" and that the rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, producing greater than .  A June 2014 talk by Mueller provided more specific engine performance target specifications indicating of sea-level thrust, of vacuum thrust, and a specific impulse (I) of for a vacuum version.  Earlier information had estimated the design I under vacuum conditions as only 363 s. Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011\u20132015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene\u2014methane is cleaner burning\u2014and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to \"live off the land\" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. \n SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015. 76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April\u2013August 2015.   SpaceX completed its planned testing at NASA Stennis in 2014 and 2015.   In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around , much lower than older statements mentioned.  This brought into question much of the speculation surrounding a 9-engine booster, as he stated \"there will be a lot of [  engines]\".  By August 2015, an Elon Musk statement surfaced that indicated the oxidizer to fuel ratio of the Mars-bound engine would be approximately 3.8 to 1.   In January 2016, the US Air Force awarded a development contract to SpaceX to develop a prototype version of its methane-fueled reusable Raptor engine for use on the upper stage of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which required double-matching funding by SpaceX of at least .  Work under the contract is expected to be completed in 2018, with engine performance testing to be done at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.   Section::::History.:Engine development and testing. \n Initial development testing of Raptor methane engine components was done at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, where SpaceX added equipment to the existing infrastructure in order to support liquid methane engine testing. Initial testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stands at the E-2 complex at Stennis were not large enough to test the full Raptor engine.  The development Raptor engine discussed in the October 2013 time frame relative to Stennis testing was designed to generate more than vacuum thrust.  A revised, higher-thrust, specification was discussed by the company in February 2014, but it was unclear whether that higher thrust was something that would be achieved with the initial development engines.   Raptor engine component testing began in May 2014 at the E-2 test complex which SpaceX modified to support methane engine tests.  The first items tested were single Raptor injector elements, various designs of high-volume gas injectors.   The modifications to the test stands made by SpaceX are now a part of the Stennis test infrastructure and are available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease was completed.   SpaceX successfully completed a \"round of main injector testing in late 2014\" and a \"full-power test of the oxygen preburner component\" for Raptor by June 2015. \nTests continued at least into September 2015.  By 2016, SpaceX had constructed a new engine test stand at their site of McGregor in central Texas that can handle the larger thrust of the full Raptor engine.   By August 2016, SpaceX confirmed that a Raptor engine had been shipped to the testing site in McGregor for development tests, and the development Raptor did an initial 9-second firing test on 26 September 2016, the day before Musk's talk at the International Aeronautical Congress.  The 2016 development engine had \"an expansion ratio of just 150, the maximum possible within Earth\u2019s atmosphere\" to prevent flow separation problems.   By August 2016, the first integrated Raptor rocket engine, manufactured at the SpaceX Hawthorne facility in California, shipped to the McGregor rocket engine test facility in Texas for development testing.  The engine had thrust, which makes it approximately one-third the size of the full-scale Raptor engine planned for flight tests in 2019/2020 timeframe.  It is the first full-flow staged-combustion methalox engine ever to reach a test stand.   On 26 September 2016, Elon Musk tweeted two images of the first test firing of an integrated Raptor in SpaceX's McGregor test complex. \nOn the same day Musk revealed that their target performance for Raptor was a vacuum specific impulse of 382\u00a0seconds, with a thrust of with a chamber pressure of and an expansion ratio of 150 for an altitude optimized version. When asked if the nozzle diameter for such version was , he stated that it was pretty close to that dimension.  He also disclosed that it used multi-stage turbopumps.  On the 27th he clarified that 150 expansion ratio was for the development version, that the production vacuum version would have an expansion ratio of 200.   Substantial additional technical details of the ITS propulsion were summarized in a technical article on the Raptor engine published the next week.   By September 2017, the development Raptor engine\u2014with chamber pressure\u2014had undergone 1200 seconds of test fire testing in ground-test stands across 42 main engine tests, with the longest test being 100 seconds (which is limited by the capacity of the ground-test propellant tanks).  , the first version of the flight engine is intended to operate at a chamber pressure of 250 bar, with the intent to raise it to 300 bar at a later time. \n By September 2017, the 200 Bar sub-scale test engine, with a thrust of and \"a new alloy to help its oxygen-rich turbopump resist oxidization, ... had completed 1200 seconds of firings across 42 tests.\"  While plans for Raptor flight testing have consistently been on the new-generation fiber-composite-material construction flight vehicles since 2016, the specific vehicle was not clarified until October 2017, when it was indicated that initial suborbital test flights would occur with a BFR spaceship.   In November 2016, the first flight tests of the Raptor engine were projected to be on the very large -diameter ITS launch vehicle, no earlier than the early 2020s.   By July 2017, the plan had been modified to do flight testing on a much smaller launch vehicle and spacecraft, and the new system architecture had \"evolved quite a bit\" since the very large \"ITS launch vehicle\" design concept from 2016.  A key driver of the 2017 architecture was to make the new system useful for substantial Earth-orbit and Cislunar launches so that the new system might pay for itself, in part, through economic spaceflight activities in the near-Earth space zone. \n Elon Musk announced in September 2017 that the initial flight platform for any Raptor engine would be some part of the BFR launch vehicle. BFR is a -diameter launch vehicle.   In October 2017, Musk clarified that \"[  initial flight testing will be with] a full-scale 9-meter-diameter ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance ...  [  projected to be] fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don\u2019t need the high area ratio, deep-space Raptor engines.\"   Notably, Musk also announced that the new Raptor-powered BFR launch vehicle was planned to entirely replace both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon spacecraft in the existing operational SpaceX fleet in the early 2020s, initially aiming at the Earth-orbit market, but SpaceX is explicitly designing in substantial capability to the spacecraft vehicles to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars mission environment as well.  SpaceX intends this approach to bring significant cost savings which will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the new launch vehicle design. \nIn addition to orbital spaceflight missions, BFR is being considered for the point-to-point Earth transportation market, with ~30\u201360 minute flights to nearly anywhere on the planet.  The first flight version of the Raptor engine planned for the \"Starship\" hopper arrived in McGregor, Texas in late January 2019.   On 3 February 2019, SpaceX performed the first test of a flight version engine.  The test lasted two seconds with the engine operating at 60 percent of rated thrust at a chamber pressure of .   Just four days later, the test engine achieved the power levels needed for use in Super Heavy and Starship.  The engine reached 172 metric tons of force (1687\u00a0kN) with a chamber pressure of .  The test was conducted using warm propellant, with expectations of a 10% to 20% increase in performance when switching to deep cryogenic temperatures for the propellant.   On 10 February 2019, Musk announced on Twitter that the flight version engine had attained the chamber combustion pressure of on a test stand. \n By March, serial number 2 (SN2) of the flight version Raptor engine had been delivered to the SpaceX South Texas launch site east of Brownsville, Texas for system integration testing on the \"Starship\" flight test rocket, the first test article of \"Starship\", approximately one year ahead of schedule. SN2 was used for two tethered integration tests of the flight test \"hopper\" in early April.  Serial numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 had all made it to the test stand by early July, but the first three had issues of various sorts and SpaceX did not try any flight tests of the Starhopper test vehicle.  SN6 was still under test on the ground test stand as of 8 July 2019.   The first flight test of a Raptor engine occurred on 25 July 2019 at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site.  Unusually, for initial flight tests of orbital-class rocket engines, this was not a full-duration burn but just a 22-second test.  SpaceX is developing their next-generation rocket to be reusable from the beginning, just like an aircraft, and thus needs to start with narrow flight test objectives, while still aiming to land the rocket successfully to be used subsequently in further tests to expand the flight envelope.   Section::::Versions. \n Section::::Versions.:IAC 2016 proposed designs.  At the IAC meetings September 2016, Musk mentioned several Raptor engine designs that could be used on the ITS launch vehicle by late in the decade.  In addition, a much smaller subscale engine had been built for test and validation of the new full-flow staged-combustion cycle engine.  At that time, this first \"subscale\" Raptor development engine had been tested on a ground test stand for only one brief firing.   BULLET::::- \"Raptor subscale development engine\"  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 40  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 200  Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2017.   At the IAC meetings of September 2017, Elon Musk announced that a smaller Raptor engine\u2014with slightly over half as much thrust as the 2016 proposed designs\u2014would be used on the BFR rocket than had been used on the ITS launch vehicle design unveiled a year earlier.  Additionally, fewer engines would be used on each stage.  BFR would have 31 Raptors on the first stage and 6 on the second stage, whereas the ITS launch vehicle design had 42 larger Raptor engines on the first stage and 9 of that same large size on the second stage. \nThe engine design remains full-flow staged combustion cycle design using subcooled liquid-methane/liquid-oxygen propellant, just like the larger 2016 engine design. \"Version 1\" of the flight engine is designed to operate at of chamber pressure; but SpaceX expects to increase this to in later iterations.  The flight engine is designed for extreme reliability, aiming to support the airline-level of safety required by the point-to-point Earth transportation market.

BULLET::::- The vacuum model Raptor, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to exert force with an I of 375s.   Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2018.   In the BFR update given in September 2018, Musk showed video of a 71 second burn of a Raptor engine, and stated that \"this is the Raptor engine that will power BFR, both the ship and the booster; it's the same engine. ...  approximately a engine aiming for roughly chamber pressure. ...  If you had it at a high expansion ratio, has the potential to have a specific impulse of 380.\" \nThe update also included a redesigned BFR upper stage with seven sea-level Raptor engines instead of the three sea-level and four vacuum on the previous design.  Later versions will be split into a sea-level design and a vacuum-optimized design again.   Section::::Applications.   As of September 2016, the Raptor engine was slated to be used in three spaceflight vehicles making up the two launch stages of an ITS launch vehicle stack.  The first stage is always an \"Interplanetary booster\" while the second stage may be either an \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an \"ITS tanker\" (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations nearer to Earth).   The SpaceX 2016-design of the Interplanetary booster was announced with 42 sea-level optimized Raptors in the first stage of the ITS launch vehicle with a total of of thrust.  The SpaceX Interplanetary Spaceship\u2014which made up the second stage of the ITS launch vehicle on Earth launches was also an interplanetary spacecraft carrying cargo and passengers to beyond-Earth-orbit destinations after on-orbit refueling\u2014was slated in the 2016 design to use six vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three Raptors with sea-level nozzles for maneuvering. \n The SpaceX 2017-design is a much smaller launch vehicle, 9 meters in diameter rather than 12 meters for the ITS launch vehicle, and is currently known by a codename \"BFR\". The BFR booster was originally planned to have 31 sea-level optimized Raptors with a total of of thrust.  The BFR spaceship (Starship) and tanker will use four vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three sea-level Raptors for maneuvering.   SpaceX will build the flight-article Starship and Super Heavy vehicles at the SpaceX South Texas build site.   Section::::See also.

Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle.   There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.   The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine.  This is seen in the F-1 rocket engine used on the Saturn V booster stage.   As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling). \n The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.  Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.  Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.   The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.   By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

[ 6] Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun.  Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement.  Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen.  It also leaks very easily.  Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints.  Liquid Hydrogen is costly too.  An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems.  SpaceX was starting a new space program with a clean-sheet design.  Because of all these problems related to LH2, SpaceX did not choose Hydrogen for their Falcon rockets.

Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.

SpaceX\u2019s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It\u2019s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let\u2019s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It\u2019s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX\u2019s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable. \nWhile the first stage of this rocket is reusable, the upper stage is not. Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it\u2019s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX\u2019s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4). \nCO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O The Methane (CH4) and water will be collected in separate containers. Starship will use Methane (CH4) and Oxygen (O2) as fuel.  The Martians can drink water (H2O) produced in this step or use it to make Oxygen and Hydrogen.  Astronauts already use these steps to produce Oxygen from water and eliminate Carbon Dioxide at the International Space Station (ISS).  As this process has been tested; therefore, we can also use it on Mars.  The only difference is, ISS releases Methane (CH4) into outer space, while on Mars, we will collect it into containers as rocket fuel.  In the above-described process, we can make both Methane (CH4) and Hydrogen (H2).   Kerosene (RP-1)  Methane Hydrogen Density 813 g/L 422 g/L 70 g/L Oxidizer vs. Fuel Ratio 2.7 : 1 3.7 : 1 6 : 1 Efficiency 370s 459s 532s Combustion Temp 3670 K 3550 K 3070 K Boiling Point 490 K 111 K 20 K Combustion Byproducts CO2, H2O, and black soot.  CO2 and H2O H2O Manufacturable on Mars No Yes Yes In rocketry, the efficiency of an engine is measured in specific impulse (ISP). \nA simplified comparison would be the MPG of our gasoline-powered vehicle. The higher the MPG of a car, the more mileage it can go on 1 gallon of gas, and the more efficient it is.  Now, let\u2019s assume that we have 1lb of rocket fuel.  It could be Kerosene (RP-1), Methane (CH4), or Hydrogen (H2).  ISP is measured in seconds.  It\u2019s the measurement for how many seconds the engine can push with 9.8 newtons of force with a fixed amount of fuel.  The higher it can push with 9.8 newtons with the same amount of fuel, the higher the efficiency or ISP.  If we have one rocket engine with 100s ISP and another one with 150s ISP, then the second engine with 150s ISP is more efficient because it can do more work with the same amount of fuel.  From the above table, we can see that Hydrogen is efficient compared to Methane.  However, Hydrogen has several issues.  SpaceX wants their rocket to be simple, cheap, and reliable.  According to Elon Musk, \u201c the best part is no part; the best process is no process.\u201d  Though Hydrogen is efficient compared to other rocket propellants, it adds complexity to rocket engines and rocket design.  Hydrogen is a cryogenic fluid. \nIt\u2019s melting point is -259\u00b0C or -435\u00b0F, and its boiling point is -252\u00b0C or -423\u00b0F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen\u2019s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth\u2019s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket\u2019s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket. \nTherefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX? \nSpaceX is a privately held company, and Elon Musk is the principal shareholder of SpaceX. During a recent FCC filing, SpaceX revealed that Elon Musk owns 54% of the company with 78% voting control in the SpaceX board. [ 1] Moreover, Elon Musk is the only person who owns more than 10% share of this company.  Can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars?  In 2020, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink started their service.  Like every other product, a new Starlink customer has to sign a legal document.  In that legal document, there is a term which states that: \u201cFor Services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonization spacecraft, the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities.  Accordingly, Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.\u201d  Therefore as you can see, if you want to get the Starlink internet, you have to declare, Mars is a free planet.  So, can SpaceX or Elon Musk claim Mars? \nYes, SpaceX can claim Mars because according to a 2015 federal law 114-90, the US government allows a private entity to mine, own, possess, and sell a celestial body, even though the US does not claim it. Therefore, according to that federal law, Elon Musk and SpaceX can claim and mine Mars.  To learn more, please click here.  Bottom Line: SpaceX made the right decision by abandoning Kerosene and Hydrogen and embracing Methane for their Starship.  One day, this Starship would take humans to Mars.

On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.  In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.

Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.

Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.

In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps.  Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.  They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. \nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures.  The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state.  It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.  Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.  Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.  Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines.  These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. \nPressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. \nThe staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.  About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket .  The non-cryogenic N 2 O 4 / UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket . \nAfter the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant.  Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.  The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle.  Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets.  The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2021.  The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.  Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper.  This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. \nThe RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.  Variants Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center.  In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber.  Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist.  Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich.  The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners.  The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion .  Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin-shaft.  In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. \nExamples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners.  Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor.  Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.  In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation.  For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.  Full-flow staged combustion cycle Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners.  The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.  The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. \nBenefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.  Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.  Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber.  This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.  Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. \nAs of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government -funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX 's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019. The first flight test of a full-flow staged-combustion engine occurred on 25 July 2019 when SpaceX flew their Raptor methalox FFSC engine at their South Texas Launch Site.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.  Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.   The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.   By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded.  Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling.  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle .  There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.  The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine. \nThis is seen in the F-1 and Merlin 1D Vacuum rocket engines used on the Saturn V booster stage and the Falcon 9 second stage, respectively. As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).  The ultimate performance of a rocket engine is primarily limited by the ability of the construction materials to withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes, as a higher temperature directly increases the local speed of sound that limits exhaust velocity.  Some engines, including the RD-107 used on the Soyuz, use a third fuel, typically Hydrogen peroxide, which decomposes as it passes over a catalyst producing gasses which are used to drive the turbines.  Engines using this system are mechanically simple, but have poor specific impulse.

The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber.  The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries.  An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor.  The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent it from overheating.  The electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps.  This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.  An electric cycle engine uses electric pumps to pressurize the propellants from a low-pressure fuel tank to high-pressure combustion chamber levels, generally from 0.2 to 0.3 MPa (29 to 44 psi) to 10 to 20 MPa (1,500 to 2,900 psi).  The pumps are powered by an electric motor, with electricity from a battery bank. \nElectrical pumps had been used in the secondary propulsion system of the Agena upper stage vehicle. As of December 2020, the only rocket engines to use electric propellant pump systems are the Rutherford engine, nine of which power the Electron rocket, and the Delphin engine, five of which power the first stage of Astra Space 's Rocket 3.  On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.  In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for turbopumps.  Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.  They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves. \nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures.  The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state.  It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.  Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.  Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.  Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines.  These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX. The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines. \nPressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. \nThe staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.  About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket .  The non-cryogenic N 2 O 4 / UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket . \nAfter the abandonment of the N-1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant.  Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.  The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle.  Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets.  The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA--the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2021.  The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.  Hydrogen peroxide / kerosene powered engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper.  This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems. \nThe RS-25 is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, similar in specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the RS-25, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.  Variants Oxidizer-rich turbine exhaust from a SpaceX Raptor preburner shown during a 2015 sub-system test on a test stand at Stennis Space Center.  In the full-flow rocket engine, the preburner exhaust is fed into a turbine and then into the main combustion chamber.  Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist.  Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich.  The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners.  The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion .  Staged combustion designs can be either single-shaft or twin-shaft.  In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. \nExamples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners.  Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor.  Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.  In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation.  For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.  Full-flow staged combustion cycle Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners.  The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.  The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner. \nBenefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.  Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.  Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber.  This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.  Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count. \nAs of 2019, only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the Soviet Energomash RD-270 project in the 1960s, the US government -funded Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated powerhead demonstration project in the mid-2000s, and SpaceX 's flight capable Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019.

The cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted.  Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  The cycle is comparable to a gas-generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.   The J-2S rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.   By 2013, Blue Origin, with their New Shepard launch vehicle, had successfully flight-tested the BE-3 engine using a tap-off cycle.  According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process.  However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures. \nIn contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the BE-3U, uses an expander cycle to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the New Glenn launch vehicle.

The engines are powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in both the Merlin and Kestrel rocket engine families.  The earliest concepts for Raptor considered liquid hydrogen () as fuel rather than methane.  The Raptor engine is currently planned to have about two times the thrust of the Merlin 1D engine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle.   The current Raptor concept as announced in 2013 is \"a highly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars\".   A variety of Raptor engines are planned to be used on both stages of the super heavy-lift launch vehicle BFR, which will have a smaller number of engines than originally planned.   Section::::Description.   The Raptor engine is powered by subcooled liquid methane and subcooled liquid oxygen using a more efficient staged combustion cycle, a departure from the simpler 'open cycle' gas generator system and lox/kerosene propellants that current Merlin engines use. \nThe Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME, with hydrolox propellant) also used a staged combustion process, as do several Russian rocket engines including the RD-180 and the chamber pressure RD-191. The stated design size for the Raptor engine varied widely during 2012\u20132017 as detailed design continued, from a high target of of vacuum thrust to a more recent, much lower target of .  In its 2017 iteration, the operational engine is expected to have a vacuum I of 375 seconds and a sea-level I of 300 seconds.   The Raptor engine is designed for the use of deep cryogenic propellants\u2014fluids cooled to near their freezing points, rather than nearer their boiling points which is more typical for cryogenic rocket engines.  The use of subcooled propellants increases propellant density to allow more propellant mass in tanks; the engine performance is also improved with sub cooled propellants.  Specific impulse is increased, and the risk of cavitation at inputs to the turbopumps is reduced due to the higher mass flow rate per unit power generated.  Engine ignition for all Raptor engines, both on the pad and in the air, will be by spark ignition, which will eliminate the pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) used for engine ignition on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. \n Raptor has been claimed to be able to deliver \"long life ... and more benign turbine environments\". Specifically, Raptor utilizes a full-flow staged combustion cycle, where 100 percent of the oxidizer\u2014with a low-fuel ratio\u2014will power the oxygen turbine pump, and 100 percent of the fuel\u2014with a low-oxygen ratio\u2014will power the methane turbine pump.  Both streams\u2014oxidizer and fuel\u2014will be mixed completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber.  Prior to 2014, only two full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands: the Soviet RD-270 project in the 1960s and the Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator in the mid-2000s.   Additional characteristics of the full-flow design, projected to further increase performance or reliability include:  BULLET::::- eliminating the fuel-oxidizer turbine interseal, which is a potential point of failure in more traditional engine designs  BULLET::::- lower pressures are required through the pumping system, increasing life span and further reducing risk of catastrophic failure  BULLET::::- ability to increase the combustion chamber pressure, thereby either increasing overall performance, or \"by using cooler gases, providing the same performance as a standard staged combustion engine but with much less stress on materials, thus significantly reducing material fatigue or [ \nengine] weight\".  The turbopump and many of the critical parts of the injectors for the initial engine development testing were, as of 2015, manufactured by using 3D printing, which increases the speed of development and iterative testing.  Forty percent (by mass) of the 2016 test stand engine was manufactured by 3D printing.   The Raptor engine uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors to admit propellants to the combustion chamber, rather than pintle injectors used on the previous Merlin rocket engines that SpaceX mass-produced for its Falcon family of launch vehicles.   Section::::History.   The engine development from 2009 to 2015 was funded exclusively through private investment by SpaceX, and not as a result of any funding from the US government.  In January 2016, SpaceX did agree with the US Air Force to take in defense department funding in order to develop a particular Raptor model: a prototype of a new upper-stage variant of the Raptor engine designed for potential use as an upper stage on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, with SpaceX agreeing to fund at least on the same upper-stage development project, on a minimum 2:1 private-to-government funding basis.   Section::::History.:Initial concept. \n An advanced rocket engine design project named \"Raptor\"\u2014then a hydrolox engine\u2014was first publicly discussed by SpaceX's Max Vozoff at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Commercial Crew/Cargo symposium in 2009. , SpaceX had a small number of staff working on the Raptor upper-stage engine, then still a /LOX concept, at a low level of priority.  Further mention of the development program occurred in 2011.  In March 2012, news accounts asserted that the Raptor upper-stage engine development program was underway, but that details were not being publicly released.   In October 2012, SpaceX publicly announced concept work on a rocket engine that would be \"several times as powerful as the Merlin 1 series of engines, and won't use Merlin's RP-1 fuel\", but declined to specify which fuel would be used.  They indicated that details on a new SpaceX rocket would be forthcoming in \"one to three years\" and that the large engine was intended for the next-generation launch vehicle using multiple of these large engines, that would be expected to launch payload masses of the order of to low Earth orbit, exceeding the payload mass capability of the NASA Space Launch System.   Section::::History.:Methane engine announcement and component development. \n In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for the propulsion division of SpaceX: developing methane-fueled rocket engines. He further indicated that the engine concept, codenamed Raptor, would now become a methane-based design, and that methane would be the fuel of choice for SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization.   Because of the presence of water underground and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars, methane, a simple hydrocarbon, can easily be synthesized on Mars using the Sabatier reaction.  In-situ resource production on Mars has been examined by NASA and found to be viable for oxygen, water, and methane production.  According to a study published by researchers from the Colorado School of Mines, in-situ resource utilization such as methane from Mars makes space missions more feasible technically and economically and enables reusability. \n When first mentioned by SpaceX in 2009, the term \"Raptor\" was applied exclusively to an upper-stage engine concept\u2014and 2012 pronouncements indicated that it was then still a concept for an upper stage engine\u2014but in early 2014 SpaceX confirmed that Raptor would be used both on a new second stage, as well as for the large (then, nominally a 10-meter-diameter) core of the then-named Mars Colonial Transporter (subsequently, in 2016, on both stages of the even larger ITS launch vehicle concept and then, in 2017 and 2018, on the currently-in-development 9-meter diameter BFR).  The earliest public hints that a staged-combustion methane engine was under consideration at SpaceX were given in May 2011 when SpaceX asked if the Air Force was interested in a methane-fueled engine as an option to compete with the mainline kerosene-fueled engine that had been requested in the USAF \"Reusable Booster System High Thrust Main Engine\" solicitation.   Public information released in November 2012 indicated that SpaceX might have a family of Raptor-designated rocket engines in mind; this was confirmed by SpaceX in October 2013. \nHowever, in March 2014 SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that the focus of the new engine development program is exclusively on the full-size Raptor engine; smaller subscale methalox engines were not planned on the development path to the very large Raptor engine.  In October 2013, SpaceX announced that they would be performing methane engine tests of Raptor engine components at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, and that SpaceX would add equipment to the existing test stand infrastructure in order to support liquid methane and hot gaseous methane engine component testing.  In April 2014, SpaceX completed the requisite upgrades and maintenance to the Stennis test stand to prepare for testing of Raptor components, and the engine component testing program began in earnest, focusing on the development of robust startup and shutdown procedures, something that is typically quite difficult to do for full-flow staged combustion cycle engines.  Component testing at Stennis also allowed hardware characterization and verification of proprietary analytical software models that SpaceX developed to push the technology on this engine cycle that had little prior development work in the West. \n October 2013 was the first time SpaceX disclosed a nominal design thrust of the Raptor engine\u2014\u2014although early in 2014 they announced a Raptor engine with greater thrust, and in 2015, one with lower thrust that might better optimize thrust-to-weight.  In February 2014, Tom Mueller, the head of rocket engine development at SpaceX, revealed in a speech that Raptor was being designed for use on a vehicle where nine engines would \"put over 100 tons of cargo up to Mars\" and that the rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, producing greater than .  A June 2014 talk by Mueller provided more specific engine performance target specifications indicating of sea-level thrust, of vacuum thrust, and a specific impulse (I) of for a vacuum version.  Earlier information had estimated the design I under vacuum conditions as only 363 s. Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011\u20132015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene\u2014methane is cleaner burning\u2014and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to \"live off the land\" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. \n SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015. 76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April\u2013August 2015.   SpaceX completed its planned testing at NASA Stennis in 2014 and 2015.   In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around , much lower than older statements mentioned.  This brought into question much of the speculation surrounding a 9-engine booster, as he stated \"there will be a lot of [  engines]\".  By August 2015, an Elon Musk statement surfaced that indicated the oxidizer to fuel ratio of the Mars-bound engine would be approximately 3.8 to 1.   In January 2016, the US Air Force awarded a development contract to SpaceX to develop a prototype version of its methane-fueled reusable Raptor engine for use on the upper stage of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which required double-matching funding by SpaceX of at least .  Work under the contract is expected to be completed in 2018, with engine performance testing to be done at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.   Section::::History.:Engine development and testing. \n Initial development testing of Raptor methane engine components was done at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, where SpaceX added equipment to the existing infrastructure in order to support liquid methane engine testing. Initial testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stands at the E-2 complex at Stennis were not large enough to test the full Raptor engine.  The development Raptor engine discussed in the October 2013 time frame relative to Stennis testing was designed to generate more than vacuum thrust.  A revised, higher-thrust, specification was discussed by the company in February 2014, but it was unclear whether that higher thrust was something that would be achieved with the initial development engines.   Raptor engine component testing began in May 2014 at the E-2 test complex which SpaceX modified to support methane engine tests.  The first items tested were single Raptor injector elements, various designs of high-volume gas injectors.   The modifications to the test stands made by SpaceX are now a part of the Stennis test infrastructure and are available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease was completed.   SpaceX successfully completed a \"round of main injector testing in late 2014\" and a \"full-power test of the oxygen preburner component\" for Raptor by June 2015. \nTests continued at least into September 2015.  By 2016, SpaceX had constructed a new engine test stand at their site of McGregor in central Texas that can handle the larger thrust of the full Raptor engine.   By August 2016, SpaceX confirmed that a Raptor engine had been shipped to the testing site in McGregor for development tests, and the development Raptor did an initial 9-second firing test on 26 September 2016, the day before Musk's talk at the International Aeronautical Congress.  The 2016 development engine had \"an expansion ratio of just 150, the maximum possible within Earth\u2019s atmosphere\" to prevent flow separation problems.   By August 2016, the first integrated Raptor rocket engine, manufactured at the SpaceX Hawthorne facility in California, shipped to the McGregor rocket engine test facility in Texas for development testing.  The engine had thrust, which makes it approximately one-third the size of the full-scale Raptor engine planned for flight tests in 2019/2020 timeframe.  It is the first full-flow staged-combustion methalox engine ever to reach a test stand.   On 26 September 2016, Elon Musk tweeted two images of the first test firing of an integrated Raptor in SpaceX's McGregor test complex. \nOn the same day Musk revealed that their target performance for Raptor was a vacuum specific impulse of 382\u00a0seconds, with a thrust of with a chamber pressure of and an expansion ratio of 150 for an altitude optimized version. When asked if the nozzle diameter for such version was , he stated that it was pretty close to that dimension.  He also disclosed that it used multi-stage turbopumps.  On the 27th he clarified that 150 expansion ratio was for the development version, that the production vacuum version would have an expansion ratio of 200.   Substantial additional technical details of the ITS propulsion were summarized in a technical article on the Raptor engine published the next week.   By September 2017, the development Raptor engine\u2014with chamber pressure\u2014had undergone 1200 seconds of test fire testing in ground-test stands across 42 main engine tests, with the longest test being 100 seconds (which is limited by the capacity of the ground-test propellant tanks).  , the first version of the flight engine is intended to operate at a chamber pressure of 250 bar, with the intent to raise it to 300 bar at a later time. \n By September 2017, the 200 Bar sub-scale test engine, with a thrust of and \"a new alloy to help its oxygen-rich turbopump resist oxidization, ... had completed 1200 seconds of firings across 42 tests.\"  While plans for Raptor flight testing have consistently been on the new-generation fiber-composite-material construction flight vehicles since 2016, the specific vehicle was not clarified until October 2017, when it was indicated that initial suborbital test flights would occur with a BFR spaceship.   In November 2016, the first flight tests of the Raptor engine were projected to be on the very large -diameter ITS launch vehicle, no earlier than the early 2020s.   By July 2017, the plan had been modified to do flight testing on a much smaller launch vehicle and spacecraft, and the new system architecture had \"evolved quite a bit\" since the very large \"ITS launch vehicle\" design concept from 2016.  A key driver of the 2017 architecture was to make the new system useful for substantial Earth-orbit and Cislunar launches so that the new system might pay for itself, in part, through economic spaceflight activities in the near-Earth space zone. \n Elon Musk announced in September 2017 that the initial flight platform for any Raptor engine would be some part of the BFR launch vehicle. BFR is a -diameter launch vehicle.   In October 2017, Musk clarified that \"[  initial flight testing will be with] a full-scale 9-meter-diameter ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance ...  [  projected to be] fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don\u2019t need the high area ratio, deep-space Raptor engines.\"   Notably, Musk also announced that the new Raptor-powered BFR launch vehicle was planned to entirely replace both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon spacecraft in the existing operational SpaceX fleet in the early 2020s, initially aiming at the Earth-orbit market, but SpaceX is explicitly designing in substantial capability to the spacecraft vehicles to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars mission environment as well.  SpaceX intends this approach to bring significant cost savings which will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the new launch vehicle design. \nIn addition to orbital spaceflight missions, BFR is being considered for the point-to-point Earth transportation market, with ~30\u201360 minute flights to nearly anywhere on the planet.  The first flight version of the Raptor engine planned for the \"Starship\" hopper arrived in McGregor, Texas in late January 2019.   On 3 February 2019, SpaceX performed the first test of a flight version engine.  The test lasted two seconds with the engine operating at 60 percent of rated thrust at a chamber pressure of .   Just four days later, the test engine achieved the power levels needed for use in Super Heavy and Starship.  The engine reached 172 metric tons of force (1687\u00a0kN) with a chamber pressure of .  The test was conducted using warm propellant, with expectations of a 10% to 20% increase in performance when switching to deep cryogenic temperatures for the propellant.   On 10 February 2019, Musk announced on Twitter that the flight version engine had attained the chamber combustion pressure of on a test stand. \n By March, serial number 2 (SN2) of the flight version Raptor engine had been delivered to the SpaceX South Texas launch site east of Brownsville, Texas for system integration testing on the \"Starship\" flight test rocket, the first test article of \"Starship\", approximately one year ahead of schedule. SN2 was used for two tethered integration tests of the flight test \"hopper\" in early April.  Serial numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 had all made it to the test stand by early July, but the first three had issues of various sorts and SpaceX did not try any flight tests of the Starhopper test vehicle.  SN6 was still under test on the ground test stand as of 8 July 2019.   The first flight test of a Raptor engine occurred on 25 July 2019 at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site.  Unusually, for initial flight tests of orbital-class rocket engines, this was not a full-duration burn but just a 22-second test.  SpaceX is developing their next-generation rocket to be reusable from the beginning, just like an aircraft, and thus needs to start with narrow flight test objectives, while still aiming to land the rocket successfully to be used subsequently in further tests to expand the flight envelope.   Section::::Versions. \n Section::::Versions.:IAC 2016 proposed designs.  At the IAC meetings September 2016, Musk mentioned several Raptor engine designs that could be used on the ITS launch vehicle by late in the decade.  In addition, a much smaller subscale engine had been built for test and validation of the new full-flow staged-combustion cycle engine.  At that time, this first \"subscale\" Raptor development engine had been tested on a ground test stand for only one brief firing.   BULLET::::- \"Raptor subscale development engine\"  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 40  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 200  Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2017.   At the IAC meetings of September 2017, Elon Musk announced that a smaller Raptor engine\u2014with slightly over half as much thrust as the 2016 proposed designs\u2014would be used on the BFR rocket than had been used on the ITS launch vehicle design unveiled a year earlier.  Additionally, fewer engines would be used on each stage.  BFR would have 31 Raptors on the first stage and 6 on the second stage, whereas the ITS launch vehicle design had 42 larger Raptor engines on the first stage and 9 of that same large size on the second stage. \nThe engine design remains full-flow staged combustion cycle design using subcooled liquid-methane/liquid-oxygen propellant, just like the larger 2016 engine design. \"Version 1\" of the flight engine is designed to operate at of chamber pressure; but SpaceX expects to increase this to in later iterations.  The flight engine is designed for extreme reliability, aiming to support the airline-level of safety required by the point-to-point Earth transportation market.   BULLET::::- The sea-level model Raptor engine design, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to have thrust at sea-level with an I of 330s increasing to an I of 356s in the vacuum of space.   BULLET::::- The vacuum model Raptor, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to exert force with an I of 375s.   Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2018.   In the BFR update given in September 2018, Musk showed video of a 71 second burn of a Raptor engine, and stated that \"this is the Raptor engine that will power BFR, both the ship and the booster; it's the same engine. ...  approximately a engine aiming for roughly chamber pressure. ...  If you had it at a high expansion ratio, has the potential to have a specific impulse of 380.\" \nThe update also included a redesigned BFR upper stage with seven sea-level Raptor engines instead of the three sea-level and four vacuum on the previous design.  Later versions will be split into a sea-level design and a vacuum-optimized design again.   Section::::Applications.   As of September 2016, the Raptor engine was slated to be used in three spaceflight vehicles making up the two launch stages of an ITS launch vehicle stack.  The first stage is always an \"Interplanetary booster\" while the second stage may be either an \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an \"ITS tanker\" (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations nearer to Earth).   The SpaceX 2016-design of the Interplanetary booster was announced with 42 sea-level optimized Raptors in the first stage of the ITS launch vehicle with a total of of thrust.  The SpaceX Interplanetary Spaceship\u2014which made up the second stage of the ITS launch vehicle on Earth launches was also an interplanetary spacecraft carrying cargo and passengers to beyond-Earth-orbit destinations after on-orbit refueling\u2014was slated in the 2016 design to use six vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three Raptors with sea-level nozzles for maneuvering. \n The SpaceX 2017-design is a much smaller launch vehicle, 9 meters in diameter rather than 12 meters for the ITS launch vehicle, and is currently known by a codename \"BFR\". The BFR booster was originally planned to have 31 sea-level optimized Raptors with a total of of thrust.  The BFR spaceship (Starship) and tanker will use four vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three sea-level Raptors for maneuvering.   SpaceX will build the flight-article Starship and Super Heavy vehicles at the SpaceX South Texas build site.   Section::::See also.

It was to be used on the first stages of proposed heavy-lift UR-700 and UR-900 rocket families.  It has the highest thrust among single-chamber engines of the USSR, 640 metric tons at the surface of Earth.  The propellants used are unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NO).  The chamber pressure was among the highest considered, being about 26 MPa.  This was achieved by applying full-flow staged combustion cycle for all the incoming mass of fuel, which is turned into a gas and passes through a couple of turbines before being burned in the combustion chamber.  This allowed the engine to achieve a specific impulse of at the Earth's surface.   The engine testing was underway when the decision was made to cancel the program.  The development of it was stopped with all other work on corresponding rocket projects on 11 December 1970.   Section::::History.   The development of RD-270 started on 26 June 1962.  Preliminary investigations and development of the engine and its further production were performed under the guidance of Valentin Glushko and finished in 1967. \nIt became the most powerful engine in the world with use of high-boiling propellant to date. During 1967\u20131969, several test firings were performed with experimental engines that were adapted to work at sea level and had a short nozzle.  In total, 27 test firings were performed with 22 engines, three engines were tested twice, and one of them was tested three times.  All works stopped later together with corresponding activities on the UR-700 project.   During development, Glushko studied the use of pentaborane \"zip\" propellants in a modified RD-270M engine.  This would have created immense toxicity problems but increased the specific impulse of the engine by .   Section::::Design.   The engine throttle range was 95\u2013105%, the thrust vector control range was \u00b112\u00b0 (project R-56) and \u00b18\u00b0 for UR-700 rocket family.  The oxidizer-to-fuel ratio was 2.67 and can be changed by up to 7%.   To achieve such a high specific impulse and pressure in combustion chamber as RD-270 has, two circuits of full-flow staged combustion cycle were applied.  The pair of turbines with preburners turns the fuel into the gaseous form and circulates all of the fuel components. \nOne of the turbines uses the fuel-rich gas to power a fuel pump, another one uses the oxidizer-rich gas to power the oxidizer pump. As a result, the main combustion chamber (MCC) burns only generator gas.  The engine controller regulates the functions of the two independent fuel and oxidizer circuits.   With the purpose to cool \"MCC\" it has layered wall structure with four internal belts of slots.  Some parts of nozzles are covered by zirconium dioxide for thermal protection.

The engines are powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the RP-1 kerosene and LOX used in both the Merlin and Kestrel rocket engine families.  The earliest concepts for Raptor considered liquid hydrogen () as fuel rather than methane.  The Raptor engine is currently planned to have about two times the thrust of the Merlin 1D engine that powers the current Falcon 9 launch vehicle.   The current Raptor concept as announced in 2013 is \"a highly reusable methane staged-combustion engine that will power the next generation of SpaceX launch vehicles designed for the exploration and colonization of Mars\".   A variety of Raptor engines are planned to be used on both stages of the super heavy-lift launch vehicle BFR, which will have a smaller number of engines than originally planned.   Section::::Description.   The Raptor engine is powered by subcooled liquid methane and subcooled liquid oxygen using a more efficient staged combustion cycle, a departure from the simpler 'open cycle' gas generator system and lox/kerosene propellants that current Merlin engines use. \nThe Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME, with hydrolox propellant) also used a staged combustion process, as do several Russian rocket engines including the RD-180 and the chamber pressure RD-191. The stated design size for the Raptor engine varied widely during 2012\u20132017 as detailed design continued, from a high target of of vacuum thrust to a more recent, much lower target of .  In its 2017 iteration, the operational engine is expected to have a vacuum I of 375 seconds and a sea-level I of 300 seconds.   The Raptor engine is designed for the use of deep cryogenic propellants\u2014fluids cooled to near their freezing points, rather than nearer their boiling points which is more typical for cryogenic rocket engines.  The use of subcooled propellants increases propellant density to allow more propellant mass in tanks; the engine performance is also improved with sub cooled propellants.  Specific impulse is increased, and the risk of cavitation at inputs to the turbopumps is reduced due to the higher mass flow rate per unit power generated.  Engine ignition for all Raptor engines, both on the pad and in the air, will be by spark ignition, which will eliminate the pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) used for engine ignition on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. \n Raptor has been claimed to be able to deliver \"long life ... and more benign turbine environments\". Specifically, Raptor utilizes a full-flow staged combustion cycle, where 100 percent of the oxidizer\u2014with a low-fuel ratio\u2014will power the oxygen turbine pump, and 100 percent of the fuel\u2014with a low-oxygen ratio\u2014will power the methane turbine pump.  Both streams\u2014oxidizer and fuel\u2014will be mixed completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber.  Prior to 2014, only two full-flow staged combustion rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands: the Soviet RD-270 project in the 1960s and the Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator in the mid-2000s.   Additional characteristics of the full-flow design, projected to further increase performance or reliability include:  BULLET::::- eliminating the fuel-oxidizer turbine interseal, which is a potential point of failure in more traditional engine designs  BULLET::::- lower pressures are required through the pumping system, increasing life span and further reducing risk of catastrophic failure  BULLET::::- ability to increase the combustion chamber pressure, thereby either increasing overall performance, or \"by using cooler gases, providing the same performance as a standard staged combustion engine but with much less stress on materials, thus significantly reducing material fatigue or [ \nengine] weight\".  The turbopump and many of the critical parts of the injectors for the initial engine development testing were, as of 2015, manufactured by using 3D printing, which increases the speed of development and iterative testing.  Forty percent (by mass) of the 2016 test stand engine was manufactured by 3D printing.   The Raptor engine uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors to admit propellants to the combustion chamber, rather than pintle injectors used on the previous Merlin rocket engines that SpaceX mass-produced for its Falcon family of launch vehicles.   Section::::History.   The engine development from 2009 to 2015 was funded exclusively through private investment by SpaceX, and not as a result of any funding from the US government.  In January 2016, SpaceX did agree with the US Air Force to take in defense department funding in order to develop a particular Raptor model: a prototype of a new upper-stage variant of the Raptor engine designed for potential use as an upper stage on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, with SpaceX agreeing to fund at least on the same upper-stage development project, on a minimum 2:1 private-to-government funding basis.   Section::::History.:Initial concept. \n An advanced rocket engine design project named \"Raptor\"\u2014then a hydrolox engine\u2014was first publicly discussed by SpaceX's Max Vozoff at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Commercial Crew/Cargo symposium in 2009. , SpaceX had a small number of staff working on the Raptor upper-stage engine, then still a /LOX concept, at a low level of priority.  Further mention of the development program occurred in 2011.  In March 2012, news accounts asserted that the Raptor upper-stage engine development program was underway, but that details were not being publicly released.   In October 2012, SpaceX publicly announced concept work on a rocket engine that would be \"several times as powerful as the Merlin 1 series of engines, and won't use Merlin's RP-1 fuel\", but declined to specify which fuel would be used.  They indicated that details on a new SpaceX rocket would be forthcoming in \"one to three years\" and that the large engine was intended for the next-generation launch vehicle using multiple of these large engines, that would be expected to launch payload masses of the order of to low Earth orbit, exceeding the payload mass capability of the NASA Space Launch System.   Section::::History.:Methane engine announcement and component development. \n In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for the propulsion division of SpaceX: developing methane-fueled rocket engines. He further indicated that the engine concept, codenamed Raptor, would now become a methane-based design, and that methane would be the fuel of choice for SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization.   Because of the presence of water underground and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars, methane, a simple hydrocarbon, can easily be synthesized on Mars using the Sabatier reaction.  In-situ resource production on Mars has been examined by NASA and found to be viable for oxygen, water, and methane production.  According to a study published by researchers from the Colorado School of Mines, in-situ resource utilization such as methane from Mars makes space missions more feasible technically and economically and enables reusability. \n When first mentioned by SpaceX in 2009, the term \"Raptor\" was applied exclusively to an upper-stage engine concept\u2014and 2012 pronouncements indicated that it was then still a concept for an upper stage engine\u2014but in early 2014 SpaceX confirmed that Raptor would be used both on a new second stage, as well as for the large (then, nominally a 10-meter-diameter) core of the then-named Mars Colonial Transporter (subsequently, in 2016, on both stages of the even larger ITS launch vehicle concept and then, in 2017 and 2018, on the currently-in-development 9-meter diameter BFR).  The earliest public hints that a staged-combustion methane engine was under consideration at SpaceX were given in May 2011 when SpaceX asked if the Air Force was interested in a methane-fueled engine as an option to compete with the mainline kerosene-fueled engine that had been requested in the USAF \"Reusable Booster System High Thrust Main Engine\" solicitation.   Public information released in November 2012 indicated that SpaceX might have a family of Raptor-designated rocket engines in mind; this was confirmed by SpaceX in October 2013. \nHowever, in March 2014 SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that the focus of the new engine development program is exclusively on the full-size Raptor engine; smaller subscale methalox engines were not planned on the development path to the very large Raptor engine.  In October 2013, SpaceX announced that they would be performing methane engine tests of Raptor engine components at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, and that SpaceX would add equipment to the existing test stand infrastructure in order to support liquid methane and hot gaseous methane engine component testing.  In April 2014, SpaceX completed the requisite upgrades and maintenance to the Stennis test stand to prepare for testing of Raptor components, and the engine component testing program began in earnest, focusing on the development of robust startup and shutdown procedures, something that is typically quite difficult to do for full-flow staged combustion cycle engines.  Component testing at Stennis also allowed hardware characterization and verification of proprietary analytical software models that SpaceX developed to push the technology on this engine cycle that had little prior development work in the West. \n October 2013 was the first time SpaceX disclosed a nominal design thrust of the Raptor engine\u2014\u2014although early in 2014 they announced a Raptor engine with greater thrust, and in 2015, one with lower thrust that might better optimize thrust-to-weight.  In February 2014, Tom Mueller, the head of rocket engine development at SpaceX, revealed in a speech that Raptor was being designed for use on a vehicle where nine engines would \"put over 100 tons of cargo up to Mars\" and that the rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, producing greater than .  A June 2014 talk by Mueller provided more specific engine performance target specifications indicating of sea-level thrust, of vacuum thrust, and a specific impulse (I) of for a vacuum version.  Earlier information had estimated the design I under vacuum conditions as only 363 s. Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011\u20132015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene\u2014methane is cleaner burning\u2014and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to \"live off the land\" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. \n SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015. 76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April\u2013August 2015.   SpaceX completed its planned testing at NASA Stennis in 2014 and 2015.   In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around , much lower than older statements mentioned.  This brought into question much of the speculation surrounding a 9-engine booster, as he stated \"there will be a lot of [  engines]\".  By August 2015, an Elon Musk statement surfaced that indicated the oxidizer to fuel ratio of the Mars-bound engine would be approximately 3.8 to 1.   In January 2016, the US Air Force awarded a development contract to SpaceX to develop a prototype version of its methane-fueled reusable Raptor engine for use on the upper stage of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which required double-matching funding by SpaceX of at least .  Work under the contract is expected to be completed in 2018, with engine performance testing to be done at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.   Section::::History.:Engine development and testing. \n Initial development testing of Raptor methane engine components was done at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, where SpaceX added equipment to the existing infrastructure in order to support liquid methane engine testing. Initial testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stands at the E-2 complex at Stennis were not large enough to test the full Raptor engine.  The development Raptor engine discussed in the October 2013 time frame relative to Stennis testing was designed to generate more than vacuum thrust.  A revised, higher-thrust, specification was discussed by the company in February 2014, but it was unclear whether that higher thrust was something that would be achieved with the initial development engines.   Raptor engine component testing began in May 2014 at the E-2 test complex which SpaceX modified to support methane engine tests.  The first items tested were single Raptor injector elements, various designs of high-volume gas injectors.   The modifications to the test stands made by SpaceX are now a part of the Stennis test infrastructure and are available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease was completed.   SpaceX successfully completed a \"round of main injector testing in late 2014\" and a \"full-power test of the oxygen preburner component\" for Raptor by June 2015. \nTests continued at least into September 2015.  By 2016, SpaceX had constructed a new engine test stand at their site of McGregor in central Texas that can handle the larger thrust of the full Raptor engine.   By August 2016, SpaceX confirmed that a Raptor engine had been shipped to the testing site in McGregor for development tests, and the development Raptor did an initial 9-second firing test on 26 September 2016, the day before Musk's talk at the International Aeronautical Congress.  The 2016 development engine had \"an expansion ratio of just 150, the maximum possible within Earth\u2019s atmosphere\" to prevent flow separation problems.   By August 2016, the first integrated Raptor rocket engine, manufactured at the SpaceX Hawthorne facility in California, shipped to the McGregor rocket engine test facility in Texas for development testing.  The engine had thrust, which makes it approximately one-third the size of the full-scale Raptor engine planned for flight tests in 2019/2020 timeframe.  It is the first full-flow staged-combustion methalox engine ever to reach a test stand.   On 26 September 2016, Elon Musk tweeted two images of the first test firing of an integrated Raptor in SpaceX's McGregor test complex. \nOn the same day Musk revealed that their target performance for Raptor was a vacuum specific impulse of 382\u00a0seconds, with a thrust of with a chamber pressure of and an expansion ratio of 150 for an altitude optimized version. When asked if the nozzle diameter for such version was , he stated that it was pretty close to that dimension.  He also disclosed that it used multi-stage turbopumps.  On the 27th he clarified that 150 expansion ratio was for the development version, that the production vacuum version would have an expansion ratio of 200.   Substantial additional technical details of the ITS propulsion were summarized in a technical article on the Raptor engine published the next week.   By September 2017, the development Raptor engine\u2014with chamber pressure\u2014had undergone 1200 seconds of test fire testing in ground-test stands across 42 main engine tests, with the longest test being 100 seconds (which is limited by the capacity of the ground-test propellant tanks).  , the first version of the flight engine is intended to operate at a chamber pressure of 250 bar, with the intent to raise it to 300 bar at a later time. \n By September 2017, the 200 Bar sub-scale test engine, with a thrust of and \"a new alloy to help its oxygen-rich turbopump resist oxidization, ... had completed 1200 seconds of firings across 42 tests.\"  While plans for Raptor flight testing have consistently been on the new-generation fiber-composite-material construction flight vehicles since 2016, the specific vehicle was not clarified until October 2017, when it was indicated that initial suborbital test flights would occur with a BFR spaceship.   In November 2016, the first flight tests of the Raptor engine were projected to be on the very large -diameter ITS launch vehicle, no earlier than the early 2020s.   By July 2017, the plan had been modified to do flight testing on a much smaller launch vehicle and spacecraft, and the new system architecture had \"evolved quite a bit\" since the very large \"ITS launch vehicle\" design concept from 2016.  A key driver of the 2017 architecture was to make the new system useful for substantial Earth-orbit and Cislunar launches so that the new system might pay for itself, in part, through economic spaceflight activities in the near-Earth space zone. \n Elon Musk announced in September 2017 that the initial flight platform for any Raptor engine would be some part of the BFR launch vehicle. BFR is a -diameter launch vehicle.   In October 2017, Musk clarified that \"[  initial flight testing will be with] a full-scale 9-meter-diameter ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance ...  [  projected to be] fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don\u2019t need the high area ratio, deep-space Raptor engines.\"   Notably, Musk also announced that the new Raptor-powered BFR launch vehicle was planned to entirely replace both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon spacecraft in the existing operational SpaceX fleet in the early 2020s, initially aiming at the Earth-orbit market, but SpaceX is explicitly designing in substantial capability to the spacecraft vehicles to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars mission environment as well.  SpaceX intends this approach to bring significant cost savings which will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the new launch vehicle design. \nIn addition to orbital spaceflight missions, BFR is being considered for the point-to-point Earth transportation market, with ~30\u201360 minute flights to nearly anywhere on the planet.  The first flight version of the Raptor engine planned for the \"Starship\" hopper arrived in McGregor, Texas in late January 2019.   On 3 February 2019, SpaceX performed the first test of a flight version engine.  The test lasted two seconds with the engine operating at 60 percent of rated thrust at a chamber pressure of .   Just four days later, the test engine achieved the power levels needed for use in Super Heavy and Starship.  The engine reached 172 metric tons of force (1687\u00a0kN) with a chamber pressure of .  The test was conducted using warm propellant, with expectations of a 10% to 20% increase in performance when switching to deep cryogenic temperatures for the propellant.   On 10 February 2019, Musk announced on Twitter that the flight version engine had attained the chamber combustion pressure of on a test stand. \n By March, serial number 2 (SN2) of the flight version Raptor engine had been delivered to the SpaceX South Texas launch site east of Brownsville, Texas for system integration testing on the \"Starship\" flight test rocket, the first test article of \"Starship\", approximately one year ahead of schedule. SN2 was used for two tethered integration tests of the flight test \"hopper\" in early April.  Serial numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 had all made it to the test stand by early July, but the first three had issues of various sorts and SpaceX did not try any flight tests of the Starhopper test vehicle.  SN6 was still under test on the ground test stand as of 8 July 2019.   The first flight test of a Raptor engine occurred on 25 July 2019 at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site.  Unusually, for initial flight tests of orbital-class rocket engines, this was not a full-duration burn but just a 22-second test.  SpaceX is developing their next-generation rocket to be reusable from the beginning, just like an aircraft, and thus needs to start with narrow flight test objectives, while still aiming to land the rocket successfully to be used subsequently in further tests to expand the flight envelope.   Section::::Versions. \n Section::::Versions.:IAC 2016 proposed designs.  At the IAC meetings September 2016, Musk mentioned several Raptor engine designs that could be used on the ITS launch vehicle by late in the decade.  In addition, a much smaller subscale engine had been built for test and validation of the new full-flow staged-combustion cycle engine.  At that time, this first \"subscale\" Raptor development engine had been tested on a ground test stand for only one brief firing.   BULLET::::- \"Raptor subscale development engine\"  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 40  BULLET::::- Raptor 2016 with expansion ratio 200  Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2017.   At the IAC meetings of September 2017, Elon Musk announced that a smaller Raptor engine\u2014with slightly over half as much thrust as the 2016 proposed designs\u2014would be used on the BFR rocket than had been used on the ITS launch vehicle design unveiled a year earlier.  Additionally, fewer engines would be used on each stage.  BFR would have 31 Raptors on the first stage and 6 on the second stage, whereas the ITS launch vehicle design had 42 larger Raptor engines on the first stage and 9 of that same large size on the second stage. \nThe engine design remains full-flow staged combustion cycle design using subcooled liquid-methane/liquid-oxygen propellant, just like the larger 2016 engine design. \"Version 1\" of the flight engine is designed to operate at of chamber pressure; but SpaceX expects to increase this to in later iterations.  The flight engine is designed for extreme reliability, aiming to support the airline-level of safety required by the point-to-point Earth transportation market.   BULLET::::- The sea-level model Raptor engine design, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to have thrust at sea-level with an I of 330s increasing to an I of 356s in the vacuum of space.   BULLET::::- The vacuum model Raptor, with a nozzle exit diameter of , is expected to exert force with an I of 375s.   Section::::Versions.:Raptor 2018.   In the BFR update given in September 2018, Musk showed video of a 71 second burn of a Raptor engine, and stated that \"this is the Raptor engine that will power BFR, both the ship and the booster; it's the same engine. ...  approximately a engine aiming for roughly chamber pressure. ...  If you had it at a high expansion ratio, has the potential to have a specific impulse of 380.\" \nThe update also included a redesigned BFR upper stage with seven sea-level Raptor engines instead of the three sea-level and four vacuum on the previous design.  Later versions will be split into a sea-level design and a vacuum-optimized design again.   Section::::Applications.   As of September 2016, the Raptor engine was slated to be used in three spaceflight vehicles making up the two launch stages of an ITS launch vehicle stack.  The first stage is always an \"Interplanetary booster\" while the second stage may be either an \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an \"ITS tanker\" (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations nearer to Earth).   The SpaceX 2016-design of the Interplanetary booster was announced with 42 sea-level optimized Raptors in the first stage of the ITS launch vehicle with a total of of thrust.  The SpaceX Interplanetary Spaceship\u2014which made up the second stage of the ITS launch vehicle on Earth launches was also an interplanetary spacecraft carrying cargo and passengers to beyond-Earth-orbit destinations after on-orbit refueling\u2014was slated in the 2016 design to use six vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three Raptors with sea-level nozzles for maneuvering. \n The SpaceX 2017-design is a much smaller launch vehicle, 9 meters in diameter rather than 12 meters for the ITS launch vehicle, and is currently known by a codename \"BFR\". The BFR booster was originally planned to have 31 sea-level optimized Raptors with a total of of thrust.  The BFR spaceship (Starship) and tanker will use four vacuum-optimized Raptors for primary propulsion plus three sea-level Raptors for maneuvering.   SpaceX will build the flight-article Starship and Super Heavy vehicles at the SpaceX South Texas build site.   Section::::See also.

Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the \u201cbicycle touring\u201d style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).

Fortunately, you have more places to carry it on a bike.  Unlike backpacking, you don\u2019t want to carry a lot of weight on your back.  Instead, most of the weight should be placed low as possible on your bike.  This improves bike handling and your riding comfort.

Check out online programs.  Learn HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Python, or whatever you are comfortable with.  Look at startups: Traditional tech companies are not always the best route for you.  Try start-ups, which require people with well-rounded personalities and useful skills such as good communication skills.  Of course, by this time you should have taught yourself some tech skills.
